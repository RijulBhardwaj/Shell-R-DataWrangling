5427,2025-04-01 06:46:54.232,"One of the biggest problems in personalised learning today is the delay in feedback. Many systems only give teachers or students useful information after a task is finished, like after a test or an assignment. This makes it hard to support students at the right time—especially when they’re struggling. This project aims to solve that issue by using real-time data to make learning more responsive, supportive, and effective for each student.

Personalised learning is meant to adapt to each student’s needs, pace, and learning style, but most current systems rely on static or delayed data—like end-of-term results or occasional teacher observations. These are often too late to help when it matters most. For example, a student might be having trouble with a topic for weeks before anyone notices. By that time, the gap may have grown larger and harder to fix.

With real-time data, teachers and learning systems can see student progress as it happens. This includes things like quiz scores, time spent on tasks, and participation. Based on this data, lessons can be adjusted right away, giving students the exact help they need—when they need it most. This leads to better learning outcomes, stronger engagement, and quicker support.

Real-time feedback can also help teachers and schools. Teachers can easily spot who’s falling behind and change their teaching style to match student needs. Schools can use this data to improve their overall teaching strategies, manage resources better, and support teachers with useful insights.

In short, this project aims to bring faster, smarter, and more personalised learning by using real-time data. It’s a step toward a more modern, effective, and student-centered education system. is this introduction good for my assignment. does it cover everything?

This means that students can now learn in ways that truly suit them, making the learning process more engaging and effective.
Building on this, intelligent systems have added a new layer of responsiveness in education. They provide teachers with live, data-driven insights into how students are performing, which allows educators to adjust their strategies and provide support exactly when it's needed. This real-time insight helps make teaching more targeted and effective. However, as Bozkus (2025) rightly points out, ""successful technology integration hinges on the training, support, and readiness of both teachers and students."" Without proper infrastructure, reliable internet access, and continuous professional development, even the most advanced technologies can struggle to deliver their full potential.
This concern is echoed in the work of Zayet et al. (2023), who propose a structured framework for personalised K–12 e-learning systems. Their model includes features such as student profiling, material filtering, and teacher validation, aimed at creating more tailored educational experiences. However, they also identify key challenges in current systems—especially a lack of real-time adaptability and dependence on delayed feedback. These gaps highlight the need for systems that don’t just react after learning activities, but that adapt during the learning process, offering immediate, intelligent feedback and adjustment.
Further supporting this view, Sapounidis and Alimisis (2021) explore educational robotics curricula and reveal that even in hands-on, tech-rich environments, many programs fall short in terms of structure and inclusivity. Their analysis shows that essential elements—such as collaborative tools, scaffolding, and multilingual support—are often missing. This points to a larger problem across educational technology: the absence of cohesive, student-centered design that works for all learners, not just a few.
Taken together, these studies demonstrate that while progress in educational technology is clear, existing systems often fall short in real-time responsiveness, inclusive design, and ease of use for both students and teachers. These gaps directly inform the direction of this project, which aims to build a fully adaptive, real-time learning environment that integrates intelligent feedback, continuous content adjustment, and practical support tools for teachers.
In conclusion, the existing body of research highlights both the promise and the current limitations of technology-enhanced learning. While tools like AI, adaptive platforms, and personalised feedback systems are becoming more common, many still fall short in key areas—particularly in offering real-time, continuously adaptive support and inclusive, teacher-friendly design. This project offers a novel approach by combining live data integration, automatic content adjustment, and built-in guidance for both students and teachers within a single, unified system. Unlike many existing solutions that provide delayed feedback or partial automation, this project delivers a fully adaptive, real-time learning experience that empowers students to learn at their own pace while equipping teachers with clear, actionable insights. It aims to create a more effective, human-centered learning environment—one that actively responds to learners’ needs as they arise and supports broader educational change. is it good now? do I need to improve it?

This allows educators to adjust their strategies in real time and provide support exactly when it's needed. However, as Bozkus et al. (2025) point out, ""successful technology integration hinges on the training, support, and readiness of both teachers and students."" Without proper infrastructure, reliable internet access, and teacher training, even the most advanced systems may not achieve their full potential. Supporting both teachers and students in using digital tools effectively is just as important as the tools themselves.

Recent work by Zayet et al. (2023) presents a comprehensive framework for personalised K–12 e-learning. Their model includes key features like student profiling, material filtering, and teacher validation, allowing content to be tailored to each learner’s behavior and preferences. However, they also highlight important limitations in current systems—such as a lack of real-time adaptability and over-reliance on delayed feedback. Many platforms still require manual approval from teachers or provide only post-activity insights. These challenges reinforce the need for systems that offer real-time feedback and continuous adjustment, ensuring students are supported during learning, not just after.

Similarly, Sapounidis et al. (2021) examine the state of educational robotics curricula and reveal that many programs, while built around advanced technologies, lack crucial educational features. These include collaborative tools, learning guidance, multilingual support, and other inclusive elements. They argue that existing curricula often lack consistency and fail to fully support diverse learning needs. Their call for a shift toward learner-centered design and DIY/maker culture reflects the growing demand for educational systems that are flexible, creative, and student-driven.

Taken together, these studies make it clear that while educational technology has come a long way, current solutions still fall short in real-time responsiveness, inclusive design, and practical classroom integration. This project directly addresses these shortcomings by offering a platform that combines real-time data analysis, automated content adaptation, and built-in support for both students and teachers.

What makes this project novel is its focus on fully automated, real-time adaptation throughout the learning experience—not just during testing or assessment. By integrating live data, intelligent decision-making, and accessible design in one seamless system, it offers a more responsive, personalised, and user-friendly learning environment than what currently exists.

In conclusion, the reviewed literature highlights both the potential and the limitations of current personalised learning systems. By closing key gaps in adaptability, support, and inclusiveness, this project provides a meaningful step forward. It supports not only better learning outcomes but also encourages broader transformation in how education is delivered and experienced. is it good now?

5427,2025-04-01 11:50:46.830,"One of the biggest problems in personalised learning today is the delay in feedback. Many systems only give teachers or students useful information after a task is finished, like after a test or an assignment. This makes it hard to support students at the right time especially when they’re struggling. This project aims to solve that issue by using real-time data to make learning more responsive, supportive, and effective for each student.
Personalised learning is meant to adapt to each student’s needs, pace, and learning style, but most current systems rely on static or delayed data like end-of-term results or occasional teacher observations. These are often too late to help when it matters most. For example, a student might be having trouble with a topic for weeks before anyone notices. By that time, the gap may have grown larger and harder to fix.
With real-time data, teachers and learning systems can see student progress as it happens. This includes things like quiz scores, time spent on tasks, and participation. Based on this data, lessons can be adjusted right away, giving students the exact help they need when they need it most. This leads to better learning outcomes, stronger engagement, and quicker support.
Real-time feedback can also help teachers and schools. Teachers can easily spot who’s falling behind and change their teaching style to match student needs. Schools can use this data to improve their overall teaching strategies, manage resources better, and support teachers with useful insights.
In short, this project aims to bring faster, smarter, and more personalised learning by using real-time data. It’s a step toward a more modern, effective, and student-centered education system. thesis my introduction is it good?

1. Introduction
○
 
One of the biggest problems in personalised learning today is the delay in feedback. Many systems only give teachers or students useful information after a task is finished, like after a test or an assignment. This makes it hard to support students at the right time especially when they’re struggling. This project aims to solve that issue by using real-time data to make learning more responsive, supportive, and effective for each student.
Personalised learning is meant to adapt to each student’s needs, pace, and learning style, but most current systems rely on static or delayed data like end-of-term results or occasional teacher observations. These are often too late to help when it matters most. For example, a student might be having trouble with a topic for weeks before anyone notices. By that time, the gap may have grown larger and harder to fix.
With real-time data, teachers and learning systems can see student progress as it happens. This includes things like quiz scores, time spent on tasks, and participation. Based on this data, lessons can be adjusted right away, giving students the exact help they need when they need it most. This leads to better learning outcomes, stronger engagement, and quicker support.
Real-time feedback can also help teachers and schools. Teachers can easily spot who’s falling behind and change their teaching style to match student needs. Schools can use this data to improve their overall teaching strategies, manage resources better, and support teachers with useful insights.
In short, this project aims to bring faster, smarter, and more personalised learning by using real-time data. It’s a step toward a more modern, effective, and student-centered education system.
 
 
 
 
 
2. Related Work
 
 
Digitalisation is playing a major role in transforming how education works today. With the help of tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and remote learning platforms, teaching and learning have become more flexible, accessible, and personalised. As Bozkus et al. (2025) explain, these technologies now allow educational systems to offer real-time feedback and individualised learning experiences that adapt to each student’s needs and progress. A key part of this transformation is the rise of adaptive learning environments, which automatically adjust content, pace, and learning methods based on a student’s performance. This means students can now learn in ways that truly suit them, making the learning process more engaging and effective.
Building on this, intelligent systems provide teachers with live, data-driven insights into how students are performing. This allows educators to adjust their strategies in real time and provide support exactly when it's needed. However, as Bozkus et al. (2025) point out, ""successful technology integration hinges on the training, support, and readiness of both teachers and students."" Without proper infrastructure, reliable internet access, and teacher training, even the most advanced systems may not achieve their full potential. Supporting both teachers and students in using digital tools effectively is just as important as the tools themselves.
Recent work by Zayet et al. (2023) presents a comprehensive framework for personalised K–12 e-learning. Their model includes key features like student profiling, material filtering, and teacher validation, allowing content to be tailored to each learner’s behavior and preferences. However, they also highlight important limitations in current systems—such as a lack of real-time adaptability and over-reliance on delayed feedback. Many platforms still require manual approval from teachers or provide only post-activity insights. These challenges reinforce the need for systems that offer real-time feedback and continuous adjustment, ensuring students are supported during learning, not just after.
Similarly, Sapounidis et al. (2021) examine the state of educational robotics curricula and reveal that many programs, while built around advanced technologies, lack crucial educational features. These include collaborative tools, learning guidance, multilingual support, and other inclusive elements. They argue that existing curricula often lack consistency and fail to fully support diverse learning needs. Their call for a shift toward learner-centered design and DIY/maker culture reflects the growing demand for educational systems that are flexible, creative, and student-driven.
Taken together, these studies make it clear that while educational technology has come a long way, current solutions still fall short in real-time responsiveness, inclusive design, and practical classroom integration. This project directly addresses these shortcomings by offering a platform that combines real-time data analysis, automated content adaptation, and built-in support for both students and teachers.
What makes this project novel is its focus on fully automated, real-time adaptation throughout the learning experience—not just during testing or assessment. By integrating live data, intelligent decision-making, and accessible design in one seamless system, it offers a more responsive, personalised, and user-friendly learning environment than what currently exists.
In conclusion, the reviewed literature highlights both the potential and the limitations of current personalised learning systems. By closing key gaps in adaptability, support, and inclusiveness, this project provides a meaningful step forward. It supports not only better learning outcomes but also encourages broader transformation in how education is delivered and experienced. If successfully implemented, it could influence future educational frameworks and policy decisions by setting a new standard for adaptive, data-driven teaching models in digital learning environments. Moreover, by enabling learning that continues beyond the classroom, it enhances students’ personal learning journeys, encouraging independent exploration and improving the real-world relevance of what they learn.

One of the biggest problems in personalised learning today is the delay in feedback. Many systems only give teachers or students useful information after a task is finished, like after a test or an assignment. Making it harder to support students at the right time, especially when they’re struggling. This project aims to solve that issue by using real-time data to make learning more responsive, supportive, and effective for each student.
Personalising learning is meant to adapt to each student’s needs, pace, and learning style, but most current systems rely on delayed data such as end-of-term results or occasional teacher observations. This makes students receive help at a later time than when needed. For example, a student might be having trouble with a topic for weeks before anyone notices. By that time, the gap may have grown larger and harder to fix.
In addition, teachers and learning platforms can monitor student progress as it occurs using real-time information. This might be quiz results, task completion times, or activity levels. According to this, lessons can be modified instantly, giving students the precise support they require when they need it most. This results in enhanced learning results, increased engagement, and more efficient support. Teachers and schools may also be supported by real-time feedback. Teachers can quite easily identify who's lagging and modify their teaching mode to suit the needs of the students. The data can be used by the schools to improve the overall teaching mode, better allocate their resources and help the teachers have meaningful insights. This project aims to swiftly, wisely, and individually learn via the use of real-time data. It is a step towards modernizing, efficiency, and student student-oriented education system.
2. Related Work
Today, digitalisation is taking a large role in changing the way education works. Tools like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and remote learning platforms have helped make teaching and learning more flexible, accessible, and personal. Now, these technologies enable educational systems to present real-time feedback and individualize learning experience according to the progress attainment and the needs of each student, as explained in Bozkus et al. (2025). One important aspect to this transformation is that of adaptive learning environments, that automatically change content, pace, and learning modes in response to a student’s performance. The implication for students is that students can now learn in ways that truly suit them, which makes learning more engaging and more effective.
Having to build on this, intelligent systems are able to provide teachers with live and data driven insights into how students are performing. The good news about it is that, because of the technologies currently available, the educators can adjust their strategies, adjust their strategy in real time so that they can offer support at that moment. According to Bozkus, K., Bayrak, F., & Inci, T. (2024), “The Role of Technology in Promoting Teacher Professionalism: An Analysis of Technology Integration in Teaching and Learning in Schools”. Even the most advanced systems might not realize all their potential if they are not accompanied by the right kind of infrastructure and training of teachers or the availability of reliable internet access. As much as the tools, it is just as important to support teachers and students in using digital tools effectively.
Zayet et al. (2023) have recently come up with a model that includes personalized K–12 e-learning. First, their model includes the key features of the student profiling, material filtering and teacher validation, which enable customized content to be arranged by each learner's behavior and preferences. At the same time, they point to significant limitations in existing systems, including a basic lack of instantaneous adaptability and overreliance on retrospective feedback. For example, many platforms still request teachers to approve activities manually instead of in front of the activity, and the majority provide post-activity insights alone. These problems emphasize the importance of systems that provide real-time feedback and continuous recalibration, which provides learning support at the time the knowledge is needed rather than after the fact.
Sapounidis et al. (2021) discuss the current state of educational robotics curricula and discuss how a plethora of them which focus on futuristic technologies are missing fundamental educational aspects. Some of these features include collaborative tools, learning guidance, and inclusive features such as learning, multilingual support, and more. However, they argue that current curricula are inconsistent, and do not entirely cater to diverse needs of learners. The shift emphasized in their proposal of learner center design and DIY/maker culture demonstrates the need for new learning systems based on customizable creativity and student centric driving force.
Out of these, these studies suggest that though the educational technology has reached a great way, today’s solutions are still lacking in real-time responsiveness, inclusive design, and easy classroom integration. To address this, this project presents a platform that combines real-time data analysis, automatic content adaptation, and built-in student and teacher support, like others.
The novelty of this project is to work with fully automated, real-time adaptation across the learning experience (and along that, not just from testing or assessment). It provides a more responsive, personalized, and user-friendly learning environment than what is currently available, by integrating live data, intelligent decision making, and accessible design in one seamless system.
 
3. Business Model
This initiative is developed for the K–12 and post-secondary environments, where delayed response and fixed learning trajectories frequently leave students behind. Using real-time data and adaptive technology, the system gives instant response and continually updates learning content to reflect individual performance, creating a more interactive and efficient educational experience.
Whereas popular sites like Khan Academy, Google Classroom, and Duolingo facilitate customised learning up to a degree, they mainly rely on static tests, exhibit limited real-time flexibility, or need teacher intervention. More domain-specific tools like DreamBox Learning, Knewton, and Smart Sparrow offer adaptive characteristics but tend not to have open integration, live dashboards for teachers, or demand costly membership. This project is unique in that it brings live performance monitoring, automated accommodation, and teacher-friendly dashboards together in one usable system tailored for widespread implementation.
Real-world success in this approach is seen in the work of Raj and Renumol (2024), who implemented a real-time adaptive learning system for undergraduate students. Their platform dynamically adjusted based on learning behavior and showed significant gains, including 30% better learning time predictions, 27.8% improvement in score prediction, and a 25.5% increase in learner satisfaction. This evidence strongly supports the potential of the proposed system.
The solution will serve multiple stakeholders: students will benefit from self-paced, supported learning; teachers will receive instant insights without added workload; administrators will be able to track performance in real time; and EdTech providers can build on a scalable, adaptable foundation.
The system is cloud-based and integrates easily into existing learning environments. Risks like user resistance will be addressed through intuitive design and continuous teacher training, while technology barriers will be mitigated via low-bandwidth and mobile compatibility. Lessons from the adoption of tools like Microsoft Teams during the pandemic show that with the right support, even large-scale tech shifts can succeed.
Looking forward, the system is designed to evolve alongside educational technology trends. Future developments could include AI-driven learning assistants, voice-based learning analytics, or integration with wearable devices for student engagement tracking. It could also support multi-language learning, inclusive design for students with disabilities, and predictive analytics for dropout prevention, ensuring long-term impact and global relevance.
In conclusion, this project not only addresses present gaps in education but is also built for the future. It supports classroom improvement, independent learning, and policy evolution—positioning it as a future-ready, sustainable innovation in personalised education.

1. Introduction

One of the biggest problems in personalised learning today is the delay in feedback. Many systems only give teachers or students useful information after a task is finished, like after a test or an assignment. Making it harder to support students at the right time, especially when they’re struggling. This project aims to solve that issue by using real-time data to make learning more responsive, supportive, and effective for each student.

Personalising learning is meant to adapt to each student’s needs, pace, and learning style, but most current systems rely ondelayed data such as end-of-term results or occasional teacher observations. This makes students receive help at a later time than when needed. For example, a student might be having trouble with a topic for weeks before anyone notices. By that time, the gap may have grown larger and harder to fix.

In addition, teachers and learning platforms can monitor student progress as it occurs using real- time information. This might be quiz results, task completion times, or activity levels. According to this, lessons can be modified instantly, giving students the precise support they require when they need it most. This results in enhanced learning results, increased engagement, and more efficient support. Teachers and schools may also be supported by real-time feedback. Teachers can quite easily identify who's lagging and modify their teaching mode to suit the needs of the students. The data can be used by the schools to improve the overall teaching mode, better allocate their resources and help the teachers have meaningful insights. This project aims to swiftly, wisely, and individually learn via the use of real-time data. It is a step towards modernizing, efficiency, and student student-oriented education system.

2. Related Work

Today, digitalisation is taking a large role in changing the way education works. Tools like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and remote learning platforms have helped make teaching and learning more flexible, accessible, and personal. Now, these technologies enable educational systems to present real-time feedback and individualize learning experience according to the progress

1

attainment and the needs of each student, as explained in Bozkus et al. (2024). One important aspect to this transformation is that of adaptive learning environments, that automatically change content, pace, and learning modes in response to a student’s performance. The implication for students is that students can now learn in ways that truly suit them, which makes learning more engaging and more effective.

Having to build on this, intelligent systems are able to provide teachers with live and data driven insights into how students are performing. The good news about it is that, because of the technologies currently available, the educators can adjust their strategies, adjust their strategy in real time so that they can offer support at that moment. According to Bozkus, K., Bayrak, F., & Inci, T. (2024), “The Role of Technology in Promoting Teacher Professionalism: An Analysis of Technology Integration in Teaching and Learning in Schools”. Even the most advanced systems might not realize all their potential if they are not accompanied by the right kind of infrastructure and training of teachers or the availability of reliable internet access. As much as the tools, it is just as important to support teachers and students in using digital tools effectively.

Zayet et al. (2023) have recently come up with a model that includes personalized K–12 e-learning. First, their model includes the key features of the student profiling, material filtering and teacher validation, which enable customized content to be arranged by each learner's behavior and preferences. At the same time, they point to significant limitations in existing systems, including a basic lack of instantaneous adaptability and overreliance on retrospective feedback. For example, many platforms still request teachers to approve activities manually instead of in front of the activity, and the majority provide post-activity insights alone. These problems emphasize the importance of systems that provide real-time feedback and continuous recalibration, which provides learning support at the time the knowledge is needed rather than after the fact. Sapounidis et al. (2021) discuss the current state of educational robotics curricula and discuss how a plethora of them which focus on futuristic technologies are missing fundamental educational aspects. Some of these features include collaborative tools, learning guidance, and inclusive features such as learning, multilingual support, and more. However, they argue that current curricula are inconsistent, and do not entirely cater to diverse needs of learners. The shift emphasized in their proposal of learner center design and DIY/maker culture demonstrates the need for new learning systems based on customizable creativity and student centric driving force.

2

Out of these, these studies suggest that though the educational technology has reached a great way, today’s solutions are still lacking in real-time responsiveness, inclusive design, and easy classroom integration. To address this, this project presents a platform that combines real-time data analysis, automatic content adaptation, and built-in student and teacher support, like others.

The novelty of this project is to work with fully automated, real-time adaptation across the learning experience (and along that, not just from testing or assessment). It provides a more responsive, personalized, and user-friendly learning environment than what is currently available, by integrating live data, intelligent decision making, and accessible design in one seamless system.

3. Business Model

This initiative is developed for the K–12 and post-secondary environments, where delayed response and fixed learning trajectories frequently leave students behind. Using real-time data and adaptive technology, the system gives instant response and continually updates learning content to reflect individual performance, creating a more interactive and efficient educational experience.

Whereas popular sites like Khan Academy, Google Classroom, and Duolingo facilitate customised learning up to a degree, they mainly rely on static tests, exhibit limited real-time flexibility, or need teacher intervention. More domain-specific tools like DreamBox Learning, Knewton, and Smart Sparrow offer adaptive characteristics but tend not to have open integration, live dashboards for teachers, or demand costly membership. This project is unique in that it brings live performance monitoring, automated accommodation, and teacher-friendly dashboards together in one usable system tailored for widespread implementation.

Real-world success in this approach is seen in the work of Raj and Renumol (2024), who implemented a real-time adaptive learning system for undergraduate students. Their platform dynamically adjusted based on learning behavior and showed significant gains, including 30% better learning time predictions, 27.8% improvement in score prediction, and a 25.5% increase in learner satisfaction. This evidence strongly supports the potential of the proposed system.

The solution will serve multiple stakeholders: students will benefit from self-paced, supported learning; teachers will receive instant insights without added workload; administrators will be able

3

to track performance in real time; and EdTech providers can build on a scalable, adaptable foundation.

The system is cloud-based and integrates easily into existing learning environments. Risks like user resistance will be addressed through intuitive design and continuous teacher training, while technology barriers will be mitigated via low-bandwidth and mobile compatibility. Lessons from the adoption of tools like Microsoft Teams during the pandemic show that with the right support, even large-scale tech shifts can succeed.

Looking forward, the system is designed to evolve alongside educational technology trends. Future developments could include AI-driven learning assistants, voice-based learning analytics, or integration with wearable devices for student engagement tracking. It could also support multi- language learning, inclusive design for students with disabilities, and predictive analytics for dropout prevention, ensuring long-term impact and global relevance.

In conclusion, this project not only addresses present gaps in education but is also built for the future. It supports classroom improvement, independent learning, and policy evolution— positioning it as a future-ready, sustainable innovation in personalised education.

Introduction
Problem Statement

Hate speech on social media is still a significant issue, leading to real-world consequences such as online harassment, discrimination, racism and violent extremism. Most social media platforms employ AI-driven moderation systems to detect and remove harmful content (Al-Sukhani et al., 2025). However, these systems are often posed with challenges where harmless content is flagged due to rigid keyword-based filtering or lack of context and where actual hate speech goes undetected due to code-mixing (Nandi, Sarkar, Mallick, & De, 2024), memes or word masking using special characters. Moreover, the lack of transparency in these AI models contributes to user distrust, as these models function as ‘black boxes’, with no clear explanation for their decisions.

Project Goals and Objectives

Given the rise in hate speech on social media and the non-transparent nature of AI, this project aims to develop a multi modal hate speech detection model that integrates text, images and user behaviour. By incorporating LIME and Grad-CAM, the model will provide clear justifications for its decisions (Raghuvanshi, 2023). This will help address the trust gap in AI moderation by offering interpretable reasons behind content flagging. This project also aims to reduce false positives and false negatives by using multiple data sources instead of relying only on textual data.

Project Description
Existing Work

There has been substantial research done on detection of hate speech on social media. Garg, Sharma, & Kumar (2024) proposes an ensemble learning model integrated further with Explainable AI (XAI) to improve hate speech classification on textual data. The paper uses a fusion of deep learning models such as BERT, LSTM, ANN and Bi-GRU, which achieved an accuracy of 93.6%. 




Imbwaga, Chittaragi, & Koolagudi (2024) reveals that the Random Forest Classifier model provided the highest accuracy in detecting hate speech in English and Kiswahili languages. Furthermore, the LIME approach was used to justify the predictions made by the model.




Al-Sukhani et al. (2025) showcases both traditional (KNN, Naive Bayes and SVM) and deep learning models (Bi-LSTM) to detect hate speech in English and Arabic, with the latter outperforming the former with superior accuracy.




Mao, Shi, & Li (2024) propose a joint model of the RoBERTa pretraining model and Swin transformer V2’s self-attention mechanism for fusing together image and text features. They used Facebook's multimodal hateful memes dataset for this purpose and achieved an accuracy of 87%.




Ryu and Lee (2024)​ propose a transfer learning approach by using pre-trained KcBERT-large, KcELECTRA-base and  KcELECTRA-base-v2022 model on a dataset consisting of political hate comments in Korean language. The KcELECTRA-base-v2022 displayed the highest accuracy of 90% compared to the other two which displayed 67% and 81% respectively.




Kamble and Joshi (2018) propose three deep learning models to detect hate speech in code-mixed Hindi-English tweets namely CNN-1D, LSTM, and BiLSTM. These models have better accuracy in comparison to other statistical classifiers such as SVM and RCF. They achieved an accuracy of 83.34%, 81.11% and 82.04% respectively.

Gap Analysis

Most existing models tend to focus on either textual data or image data without considering both together; this lack of multimodal integration is a major limitation. Another major issue is these models struggle with sarcasm, euphemisms and the implicit nature of hate speech. Thus, the models might flag sarcastic posts as hate speech while hate speech disguised in coded language might slip through these detectors. Finally, the lack of reasoning for flagging content under hate speech increases user distrust as they might feel their content has been unfairly moderated.

Novelty

The project addresses the above gaps by proposing a Multimodal Hate Speech Detection model integrated with XAI. This model focuses on both text and image data to capture a more comprehensive understanding of hate speech. The use of XAI techniques such as LIME and Grad-CAM will provide reasoning for content flagging (Raghuvanshi, 2023), thus giving users an understanding of how decisions are made.

Business Model
Application Area

This project has significant applications within the social media sector. This model can be integrated into the content moderation systems of  major platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and Instagram to improve the detection and management of hate speech. Additionally, various government regulatory bodies can employ this model to curb the rising issue of online extremism and coordinated hate campaigns while also enforcing transparency in AI-driven decision-making.

Benefits

The project provides numerous benefits, which includes:

Market Opportunity: The global AI-content moderation market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.8%, reaching a staggering $3.4 billion by 2032 (Sharma, 2023). This project addresses the increasing demand for AI-powered moderation systems by integrating XAI in hate speech detection systems.

Social Media Platforms: Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram significantly benefit from improved hate speech detection accuracy, reducing false positives and negatives. This results in fewer wrongful content removals and maintains platform engagement.

Regulatory Bodies: Government agencies and regulatory bodies can employ XAI for maintaining transparency while effectively identifying harmful content.

User Trust & Experience: By integrating LIME and Grad-CAM for transparency, the model provides clear explanations for flagged content allowing users to understand why their posts were removed and reducing frustration over unjustified bans or restrictions.

Technological Advancement: Multimodal AI models (such as CLIP + BERT) offer state-of-the-art hate speech detection by analyzing both text and images together. Its integration with XAI leads to better contextual understanding and provides good  reasoning.

Introduction
Problem Statement

Hate speech on social media is still a significant issue, leading to real-world consequences such as online harassment, discrimination, racism and violent extremism. Most social media platforms employ AI-driven moderation systems to detect and remove harmful content (Al-Sukhani et al., 2025). However, these systems are often posed with challenges where harmless content is flagged due to rigid keyword-based filtering or lack of context and where actual hate speech goes undetected due to code-mixing (Nandi, Sarkar, Mallick, & De, 2024), memes or word masking using special characters. Moreover, the lack of transparency in these AI models contributes to user distrust, as these models function as ‘black boxes’, with no clear explanation for their decisions.

Project Goals and Objectives

Given the rise in hate speech on social media and the non-transparent nature of AI, this project aims to develop a multi modal hate speech detection model that integrates text, images and user behaviour. This project is important to curb the rising issue of online harassment and build user trust by providing transparency. By incorporating LIME and Grad-CAM, the model will provide clear justifications for its decisions (Raghuvanshi, 2023). This will help address the trust gap in AI moderation by offering interpretable reasons behind content flagging. This project also aims to reduce false positives and false negatives by using multiple data sources instead of relying only on textual data.

Ryu and Lee (2024)​ propose a transfer learning approach by using pre-trained KcBERT-large, KcELECTRA-base and  KcELECTRA-base-v2022 model on a dataset consisting of political hate comments in Korean language. The KcELECTRA-base-v2022 displayed the highest accuracy of 90% compared to the other two which displayed 67% and 81% respectively.




Kamble and Joshi (2018) propose three deep learning models to detect hate speech in code-mixed Hindi-English tweets namely CNN-1D, LSTM, and BiLSTM. These models have better accuracy in comparison to other statistical classifiers such as SVM and RCF. They achieved an accuracy of 83.34%, 81.11% and 82.04% respectively.

Gap Analysis

Most existing models tend to focus on either textual data or image data without considering both together; this lack of multimodal integration is a major limitation. Another major issue is these models struggle with sarcasm, euphemisms and the implicit nature of hate speech. Thus, the models might flag sarcastic posts as hate speech while hate speech disguised in coded language might slip through these detectors. Finally, the lack of reasoning for flagging content under hate speech increases user distrust as they might feel their content has been unfairly moderated.

Novelty

The project addresses the above gaps by proposing a Multimodal Hate Speech Detection model integrated with XAI. This model focuses on both text and image data to capture a more comprehensive understanding of hate speech. The use of XAI techniques such as LIME and Grad-CAM will provide reasoning for content flagging (Raghuvanshi, 2023), thus giving users an understanding of how decisions are made.

Business Model
Application Area

This project has significant applications within the social media sector. This model can be integrated into the content moderation systems of  major platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and Instagram to improve the detection and management of hate speech. Additionally, various government regulatory bodies can employ this model to curb the rising issue of online extremism and coordinated hate campaigns while also enforcing transparency in AI-driven decision-making.

Benefits

The project provides numerous benefits, which includes:

Market Opportunity: The global AI-content moderation market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.8%, reaching a staggering $3.4 billion by 2032 (Sharma, 2023). This project addresses the increasing demand for AI-powered moderation systems by integrating XAI in hate speech detection systems.

Social Media Platforms: Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram significantly benefit from improved hate speech detection accuracy, reducing false positives and negatives. This results in fewer wrongful content removals and maintains platform engagement.

Regulatory Bodies: Government agencies and regulatory bodies can employ XAI for maintaining transparency while effectively identifying harmful content.

User Trust & Experience: By integrating LIME and Grad-CAM for transparency, the model provides clear explanations for flagged content allowing users to understand why their posts were removed and reducing frustration over unjustified bans or restrictions.

5584,2025-04-02 05:47:07.678,"To effectively address the considerations associated with using the Sparse Horseshoe EM (SH-EM) algorithm in your Bayesian regression model for forecasting inflation, here are some practical steps:

1. **Computational Resources**:
   - **Access to Infrastructure**: Ensure you have access to powerful computing resources, such as cloud-based solutions (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) or university-provided computing clusters.
   - **Efficient Coding**: Optimize your code for efficiency. Use vectorized operations and libraries optimized for performance (e.g., NumPy, SciPy in Python) to reduce computational load.

2. **Model Validation**:
   - **Benchmark Against Known Models**: Compare your Bayesian model’s forecasts with those from traditional models (e.g., ARIMA) to validate its performance.
   - **Use of Historical Data**: Test the model on historical data where actual CPI outcomes are known to measure accuracy.

3. **Cross-validation**:
   - **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Employ k-fold validation to assess the model's stability and consistency. This approach helps evaluate how the model performs across different subsets of data.
   - **Training and Test Sets**: Carefully split your data into training and test sets. Ensure that these sets are representative and unbiased, helping validate that the findings are not due to overfitting.

4. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Track model performance over time and adapt to incorporate new data, ensuring it remains relevant with changing economic conditions.
   - **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust the hyperparameters of the horseshoe prior methodically based on validation results to optimize the model performance.

By tackling these considerations, you'll be well-prepared to implement the SH-EM algorithm effectively within your Bayesian framework, enhancing model credibility and robustness.",Chatbot
5584,2025-04-02 05:49:16.764,To deal with those considerations: isn't one of the specific benefits of SH-EM that it avoids heavy computation? Model validation will be against the realised ABS CPI as a benchmark and the forecast RBA CPI. Cross-validation - I can cover all the time periods I have data for (potentially approx 20 years),Student
5584,2025-04-02 05:49:26.701,"You're correct that one of the significant benefits of the Sparse Horseshoe EM (SH-EM) algorithm is its efficiency in handling high-dimensional data without the heavy computational demands typical of traditional MCMC methods. Here’s how you can address the considerations with this context in mind:

1. **Computational Resources**:
   - **Efficiency of SH-EM**: Indeed, the SH-EM algorithm is designed to be computationally lighter and more efficient, making it particularly suitable for high-dimensional datasets with many predictors. This allows you to focus on model development rather than being constrained by computational limits.

2. **Model Validation**:
   - **Benchmarking**: Using the realised ABS CPI as your benchmark for validation is an excellent approach. It allows you to measure the accuracy of your forecasts against accurate, official data.
   - **Comparison with RBA Forecasts**: By comparing your model's forecasts with those from the RBA, you'll highlight your model's predictive capabilities relative to an established authority, providing meaningful context and validation.

3. **Cross-validation**:
   - **Temporal Consistency**: Covering approximately 20 years of data is robust, as it allows your model to be tested across different economic conditions and timeframes, ensuring validity and stability over time.
   - **Time-Based Splits**: Use time-based cross-validation techniques such as rolling or expanding window validation to ensure that your model generalizes well across different time periods.

By leveraging the computational benefits of SH-EM and framing your validation and cross-validation strategies against reliable benchmarks and over extensive periods, you're set to develop a comprehensive and impactful predictive model.

5604,2025-03-25 04:50:23.770,"In the field of cricket analytics, various methods have been used to visualize bowling performance. A notable example is Sanjay Kumar’s work titled “Visualizing Bowling Performance in Cricket Using Contour Plots” (2018), which proposes the use of contour plots to represent a bowler's effectiveness across multiple performance dimensions—such as average, strike rate, and economy—over time. This method allows for intuitive comparison of bowlers from different eras and simplifies complex data into understandable visual forms.

However, the approach is largely aggregate-focused, emphasizing summary metrics rather than in-game tactical behavior. It does not consider temporal delivery patterns, such as how a bowler varies pace, line, or length within a spell to deceive a batter. Additionally, it lacks sequence-based insights—for instance, whether a bowler consistently uses a particular setup (e.g., two short balls followed by a slower yorker), or how they adapt strategies across venues or against different types of batters.

Furthermore, while contour plots offer valuable visual summaries, they are not suited for real-time or near-real-time analysis, which limits their application in live decision-making scenarios. There is also little emphasis on venue-specific context, which is increasingly important in formats like the Big Bash League (BBL), where pitch behavior can vary significantly.

This project builds on Kumar’s visualization-driven approach but moves toward a micro-level, real-time analyzer that focuses on tactical deception and sequence recognition. By leveraging ball-by-ball data and applying clustering or sequence mining techniques, the proposed system aims to detect and visualize real-time bowling patterns that can support tactical decisions.

In this study, Kumar applies contour plots to represent a bowler’s performance using metrics like average, strike rate, and economy rate. These plots allow for visual comparison between players, illustrating trends such as a bowler’s improvement over time or effectiveness across match formats. While these visualizations help summarize performance histories, they are largely focused on aggregate-level statistics.

However, this approach presents key limitations. Kumar’s method does not account for delivery sequences, nor does it analyze how bowlers adapt their strategies over a spell or an innings. It also lacks the ability to capture tactical deception— such as deliberate variations in pace or length — which play a crucial role in outsmarting batters during matches. Without a focus on temporal and sequential data, contour plots are unable to support real-time tactical decision-making or detect recurring in-match patterns.

In contrast, the proposed project builds on Kumar’s visual approach but introduces micro-level analysis using sequence mining and clustering techniques (e.g., Dynamic Time Warping, K-Means). These methods aim to identify recurring tactical sequences (e.g., two short balls followed by a slower one) and adapt those findings to real-time or near-real-time use. This is particularly valuable in dynamic leagues like the Big Bash League (BBL), where bowlers must frequently adapt strategies to venue-specific conditions like bounce at the SCG or pace at Optus Stadium.

By transitioning from summary-based to sequence-based analysis, this project aims to unlock a new layer of tactical insight. It empowers coaches, analysts, and players to make more informed decisions during and after matches, while also opening opportunities for fan engagement, interactive coaching, and future integration into live match broadcasts.

In this work, Kumar applies contour plots—graphical representations that use curved lines to connect data points with equal values—to summarize a bowler’s key metrics such as average, economy rate, and strike rate across time. These plots offer intuitive comparisons, helping analysts visually assess a bowler’s career performance trajectory.

While this method provides an effective overview, it lacks the ability to capture sequential behavior or contextual decision-making. For instance, it cannot identify if a bowler consistently follows a wide yorker with a bouncer or how their approach changes under scoreboard pressure. Such micro-patterns and deception strategies are vital in modern T20 cricket, where tactical shifts happen ball-by-ball. The absence of these insights limits the value of contour plots for in-game adjustments, strategic planning, or player-specific match-ups.

This project builds on Kumar’s visualization-driven foundation but introduces a novel layer of tactical analysis. It applies advanced techniques like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to measure similarity between delivery sequences, and K-Means clustering to group spells by tactical patterns. These approaches enable real-time or near-real-time analysis of how a bowler varies line, length, or pace to deceive batters—information that is currently only available through manual video analysis.

In a league like the Big Bash (BBL), where bowlers must adjust strategies based on venue conditions (e.g., SCG’s turn or Optus Stadium’s bounce), this tool could support pre-match preparation by highlighting opponent-specific tactics, or in-match decisions by alerting analysts to predictable sequences.

Stakeholders include coaches (pre-match prep), analysts (strategy breakdowns), and players (self-review). By narrowing the scope to select teams and bowlers, this project aims to uncover how elite players vary their tactical patterns across different match contexts, contributing to more data-driven decision-making in cricket. While this system currently operates on historical ball-by-ball data, its architecture is designed with real-time extension in mind. Additionally, the analysis no longer filters matches by venue, enabling a broader view of each bowler’s tactical tendencies across varied conditions.

5604,2025-04-03 07:57:49.443,"Uncovering Bowling Strategy in T20 Cricket: A Tactical Pattern Analyzer Using Historical Ball-by-Ball Data

            

Introduction

In modern T20 cricket, bowlers are strategic assets tasked with outsmarting batters under intense pressure. Through subtle variations in line, length, and pace, they aim to disrupt scoring momentum and force errors. However, current tools used for bowling analysis are largely retrospective — limited to post-match reviews or video tagging — which restricts real-time tactical adaptation during matches.

This project proposes a Real-Time Bowling Pattern Analyzer, a system that processes historical ball-by-ball data to detect recurring delivery sequences, deception strategies, and pace variation patterns. By analyzing delivery order, line-length consistency, and speed shifts, the system can uncover tactical trends in a bowler’s spell and visualize them for coaches, players, and analysts. This can aid decision-making — for example, recognizing when a bowler repeatedly follows two short balls with a slower yorker could help a batter anticipate and counter it in real-time.

The project focuses on the Big Bash League (BBL), analyzing matches played between 2019 and 2024 by Perth Scorchers, Melbourne Stars, and Sydney Sixers, focusing on eight elite bowlers across various venues— to compare deception strategies and adaptability across players .The system will be evaluated on its ability to identify repeated patterns, cluster delivery styles, and produce visual outputs that assist tactical planning. Stakeholders include coaches (pre-match prep), analysts (strategy breakdowns), and players (self-review). By narrowing the scope to select teams and bowlers, this project aims to uncover how elite players vary their tactical patterns across different match contexts, contributing to more data-driven decision-making in cricket.While this system currently operates on historical ball-by-ball data, its architecture is designed with real-time extension in mind. Additionally, the analysis no longer filters matches by venue, enabling a broader view of each bowler’s tactical tendencies across varied conditions.

Related Work
A notable contribution to bowling performance visualization in cricket analytics is Sanjay Kumar’s (2018) study, “Visualizing Bowling Performance in Cricket Using Contour Plots”. In this work, Kumar applies contour plots—graphical representations that use curved lines to connect data points with equal values—to summarize a bowler’s key metrics such as average, economy rate, and strike rate across time. These plots offer intuitive comparisons, helping analysts visually assess a bowler’s career performance trajectory.

While this method provides an effective overview, it lacks the ability to capture contextual decision-making. For instance, it cannot identify if a bowler consistently follows a wide yorker with a bouncer or how their approach changes under scoreboard pressure. Such micro-patterns and deception strategies are vital in modern T20 cricket, where tactical shifts happen ball-by-ball. The absence of these insights limits the value of contour plots for in-game adjustments, strategic planning, or player-specific match-ups.

This project builds on Kumar’s visualization-driven foundation but introduces a novel layer of tactical analysis. It applies advanced techniques like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to measure similarity between delivery sequences, and K-Means clustering to group spells by tactical patterns. These approaches enable real-time or near-real-time analysis of how a bowler varies line, length, or pace to deceive batters—information that is currently only available through manual video analysis.

In a league like the Big Bash (BBL), where bowlers must adjust strategies based on venue conditions (e.g., SCG’s turn or Optus Stadium’s bounce), this tool could support pre-match preparation by highlighting opponent-specific tactics, or in-match decisions by alerting analysts to predictable sequences.

The system has the potential to benefit coaches (tactical drills), analysts (live feedback), and players (pattern awareness), while also offering broadcasters and fans enriched storytelling during live coverage. Future integration with broadcast graphics or interactive dashboards could make advanced analytics more accessible, enhancing both professional strategy and spectator engagement.

Rogue-like games, are a sub-genre of role-playing video games (RPG). These games are characterized by features such as randomly generated levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the character. The genre gets its name from the 1980 game ""Rogue,"" which pioneered these elements. During the software development life circle, developers need to manually write codes, test game data and balance game values. After game release, developing team need to release patches continuously to adjust game values according to player feedback. These requires lots of investment, man power and time.

However, most user’s feedback is related to their gaming level. The procedurally generated levels and preset game values cannot fit everyone’s gaming level, so some players feel the game is challenging and attractive while others feel the game is boring and time-wasting.

In order to reduce investment in man power and funds, make the game more replayable and attractive, provide a better experience for all players, increase player retention and create more revenue, the game levels should be designed based on players gaming level. To achieve this, a GenAI powered system can analyze player’s gameplay patterns and generate levels based on their ability, taking the game type into account. By using the GenAI powered system, the game levels can be dynamically generated after analysis player’s behavior. In this way, the work of balancing game values and releasing patches will be reduced, saving man power and budget.

Introduction





Agriculture is increasingly affected by
climate change, with unpredictable weather patterns, extreme events such as
droughts and floods, and water shortages posing direct risks to food security
and farmer livelihoods. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), climate change could reduce global crop yields by up to 25% by 2050 if
adaptive measures are not implemented. Traditionally, planting schedules have
been determined based on historical trends or rigid seasonal calendars, making
it difficult to respond effectively to rapid climate shifts. This highlights
the necessity for innovative solutions that offer adaptability and precision.
To address this issue, this research introduces an AI-driven Dynamic Planting
Optimization System that integrates data science and artificial intelligence to
improve agricultural resilience. By leveraging machine learning and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), the system synthesizes meteorological conditions,
soil characteristics, historical crop performance, and farmer insights to
generate tailored climate forecasts. These predictions aid in formulating
optimal planting strategies over a six-month period, offering specific guidance
on sowing schedules, crop selection, and resource allocation. The system primarily
relies on publicly available agricultural datasets, such as those from NASA and
FAO, while farmer insights are collected through digital platforms like Twitter
or controlled simulations, ensuring the system remains both practical and
scalable within the scope of this project.





Related Work





Despite progress in agricultural
technology, existing optimization systems still exhibit limitations. Many
industry solutions, such as John Deere’s precision farming technologies,
primarily depend on past data and static climate models, which lack the ability
to dynamically incorporate real-time environmental changes such as sudden
temperature fluctuations or variations in soil moisture. For instance, a 2021
study by the University of Illinois found that static models failed to predict
yield variations in 30% of extreme weather scenarios due to their reliance on
historical averages. Similarly, Climate Corporation employs predictive modeling
techniques like decision trees and regression analysis; however, these methods
do not fully utilize GAN-based future climate scenario generation, thereby
limiting the accuracy of long-term planting projections. Research published in Nature
Communications (2020) indicates that traditional regression models
underestimate climate variability impacts by 15-20% compared to advanced
simulation techniques. Furthermore, many current tools prioritize immediate
yield improvement over sustainable resource management and environmental
concerns. A report by the World Resources Institute (WRI) notes that
inefficient irrigation practices waste up to 60% of water in some regions,
highlighting the need for resource-focused optimization. Additionally, the
absence of real-time interactive feedback mechanisms prevents farmers from
adjusting planting strategies based on localized conditions. To overcome these
shortcomings, this study proposes an approach that enhances climate forecasting
by incorporating GAN-driven models, which simulate future weather variations
with greater accuracy. It also integrates real-time meteorological updates,
soil condition analysis, historical crop growth trends, and farmer inputs to
enhance adaptability. Furthermore, by embedding environmental factors such as
water efficiency, fertilizer optimization, and carbon footprint reduction into
the system’s decision-making framework, this project ensures that agricultural
practices align with both economic viability and sustainability
goals—potentially reducing water use by up to 20%, as demonstrated in similar
precision agriculture studies (FAO, 2019). The development of a user-friendly
interactive platform also allows farmers to provide real-time observations and
receive adaptive recommendations, making the system more accessible and
practical. By addressing these gaps, this AI-powered system offers a more
precise, responsive, and sustainable approach to agricultural planning.





Business Model





This project focuses on utilizing AI to
develop climate-adaptive agricultural strategies while promoting digital
transformation in modern farming. The system synthesizes climate data from
sources such as NASA and NOAA, soil condition reports from FAO, and direct
farmer feedback, employing machine learning and GANs to deliver actionable
insights for optimized planting decisions. Data from these sources is processed
to generate precise planting strategies tailored to local conditions. The
project’s value lies in its ability to enhance climate adaptability, improve
resource management, and contribute to food security. By forecasting optimal
planting strategies up to six months in advance, the system enables farmers to
prepare for extreme climate conditions, reducing losses caused by unpredictable
weather patterns—potentially mitigating yield declines of 10-25% projected
under worsening climate scenarios (FAO, 2021). Additionally, the platform
facilitates more efficient use of water and fertilizers, cutting production
costs and minimizing environmental impact, with studies suggesting precision
irrigation can reduce water use by 20-30% (World Bank, 2020). Beyond economic
benefits, the system contributes to greater yield stability, reinforcing food
security at a global level, a critical factor given that 690 million people
faced hunger in 2019 (FAO, 2020).





The primary stakeholders include
farmers, agribusinesses, and government agencies. Farmers gain access to
personalized recommendations that help refine planting schedules, optimize crop
choices, and manage resources effectively, leading to improved productivity and
income stability. Agricultural enterprises benefit from increased resource
efficiency, as precise irrigation and optimized fertilization minimize waste
and enhance land productivity—potentially boosting profitability by optimizing
inputs, as evidenced by a 15% cost reduction in precision farming pilots (USDA,
2022). Government agencies can use the system’s climate-adaptive data and early
food security warnings to shape informed agricultural policies, fostering
resilience in regional farming systems while promoting environmental
sustainability. To ensure robust data security, the system incorporates AES-256
encryption, safeguarding sensitive information against unauthorized access. By

the best planting strategies over a period of six months, providing
recommendations on when crops should be sown, what to sow and how and when to
apply resources. As this project did not allow for wide stakeholder engagement,
the system is still predominantly data driven, using known agricultural
datasets available for public access, e.g., from NASA and FAO, while an
additional data source of narratives from farmers comes through social media

agricultural technologies have improved, current optimization systems are still
very limited. Many industry solutions, including John Deere’s precision farming
technologies, primarily rely on past data and relatively static climate models

temperature spikes or changes in soil moisture. To take one example, a 2021
study conducted by the University of Illinois found that static models were
unable to predict yield fluctuations in 30% of extreme weather scenarios
because they relied on historical averages. Likewise, Climate Corporation
utilizes predictive modeling techniques ranging from decision trees to
regression analysis, but doesn't utilize full GAN based future climate scenario generation,
limiting the accuracy of long term planting predictions. According to research
published in Nature Communications (2020), this underestimation is around
15-20% as average traditional regression models are found to underestimate
climate variability impacts versus advanced simulation techniques. The vast
majority of tools used today are focused on yield but not always optimising the
use of resources or environmental concerns. The World Resources Institute (WRI)
published a report showing that inefficient irrigation methods squander as much
as 60% of water in certain areas4; this points to the necessity to optimise the
use of resources. Moreover, there is no real-time interactive feedback
mechanism, which does not allow farmers to adjust the planting strategy
according to the local conditions. For tackling these problems, this work
presents a new improved technique for climate prediction by using GAN-based

combines climate data from sources including NASA and NOAA, as well as soil
condition information from FAO and direct insights from farmers, to provide
actionable insights on optimized planting decisions. This data is used to
create highly accurate planting plans specific to local conditions. The project
is valuable primarily due to its potential where climate adaptability is
concerned, but also where resource management and food security are concerned.
The forecasting system allows farmers to prepare for extreme climate conditions
and to develop planting strategies as much as 6-months in advance of projected
weather, reducing loss due to unpredictable weather patterns09 million farmers
may benefit from the system, potentially lessening yield declines (up to 10-25%
depending on the climate scenario) that are projected with worsening climates
(FAO, 2021). The main users include farmers, agribusinesses, and government
agencies. This allows farmers to receive personalized recommendations that
fine-tune planting schedules, identify the most conducive crops, and make
efficient use of resources, resulting in increased productivity and income
security.





Agricultural
enterprises (farms) benefit from increased efficiency of their resources:
fertilizer and water as precision irrigation and precision fertilization reduce
waste and increase the land productivity (this could even lead to
higher profits due to precise input management, the precision farming pilots
show 15% cost savings (USDA, 2022)). The climate-adaptive data set and early
food security warning derived from the system can be utilized by government
agencies to formulate informed agricultural policies, building resilience in
regional farming systems and ensuring environmental sustainability. For
improved data security, the system uses AES-256 encryption, protecting
sensitive data from unauthorized access.This project provides a novel solution

by up to 25% by 2050. Traditionally, planting schedules have relied on
historical trends or fixed seasonal calendars, limiting the ability to respond
effectively to rapid climate shifts. This exposes the need for innovative
solutions that offer flexibility and accuracy. To address this challenge, this
study introduces an AI-based Dynamic Planting Optimization System that
integrates data science and artificial intelligence to enhance agricultural
resilience. Using machine learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
the system integrates complementary meteorological conditions, soil
characteristics, historical crop performance, and farmer insights to generate
personalized climate forecasts. These forecasts help develop optimal planting
strategies over a six-month period, providing recommendations on when to sow,
which crops to plant, and how to allocate resources. Due to the limited scope
for broad stakeholder engagement in this project, the system is primarily
data-driven, utilizing publicly available agricultural datasets from NASA and
FAO. Additionally, farmer insights are collected through social media platforms
like Twitter and controlled environments, ensuring the system remains both
practical and scalable.





Related Work

Although agricultural technologies have made significant strides, current
optimization systems still face many limitations. Many industry solutions, such
as John Deere’s precision farming technologies, primarily rely on historical
data and relatively static climate models, which do not incorporate real-time
environmental changes like sudden temperature spikes or shifts in soil
moisture. For example, a 2021 study by the University of Illinois found that
static models failed to predict yield fluctuations in 30% of extreme weather
events due to their reliance on historical averages. Similarly, Climate
Corporation uses predictive modeling techniques such as decision trees and
regression analysis, but it does not fully incorporate GAN-based future climate
scenario generation, which limits the accuracy of long-term planting
projections. According to a study published in Nature Communications
(2020), traditional regression models tend to underestimate climate variability
impacts by around 15-20% compared to advanced simulation techniques. Most
current tools focus on yield improvement but often overlook resource
optimization and environmental sustainability. A report by the World Resources
Institute (WRI) highlighted that inefficient irrigation methods waste as much
as 60% of water in some areas, underscoring the need for more efficient
resource management. Additionally, the lack of real-time feedback mechanisms
prevents farmers from adjusting their planting strategies based on localized
conditions. To address these challenges, this research introduces an improved
technique for climate prediction, using GANs to simulate future climate
scenarios with greater accuracy. This study also proposes an interactive
platform that allows farmers to submit real-time observations in exchange for
adaptive recommendations, making the system more user-friendly and accessible.
By addressing these gaps, this AI-powered system provides a more accurate,
responsive, and sustainable approach to agricultural planning.





Business Model

This project aims to leverage AI to support climate-smart agricultural
practices while promoting the digital transformation of the agricultural
sector. By integrating machine learning and GANs, the system combines climate
data from sources like NASA and NOAA, soil condition data from FAO, and direct
farmer insights to provide actionable recommendations for optimized planting
decisions. This system creates highly accurate planting strategies tailored to
local conditions. The project's value lies in its potential to improve climate
adaptability, resource management, and food security. By forecasting optimal
planting strategies up to six months in advance, the system enables farmers to
prepare for extreme weather events, potentially reducing losses from unpredictable
weather patterns. The system could benefit millions of farmers, reducing yield
declines of 10-25% (depending on climate scenarios) projected under worsening
climate conditions (FAO, 2021).





The primary users of this system include
farmers, agribusinesses, and government agencies. Farmers will receive
personalized recommendations that optimize planting schedules, select the most
suitable crops, and improve resource allocation, resulting in increased
productivity and income stability. Agricultural enterprises will benefit from
improved resource efficiency, as precision irrigation and fertilization reduce
waste and increase land productivity. This can potentially lead to higher
profits through optimized input management, with studies showing cost savings
of up to 15% in precision farming pilots (USDA, 2022). Government agencies can
use the climate-adaptive data and early food security warnings generated by the
system to formulate informed agricultural policies that promote resilience in
regional farming systems and ensure environmental sustainability. For enhanced
data security, the system employs AES-256 encryption to protect sensitive data
from unauthorized access. This project provides a novel solution to
climate-adaptive agriculture by applying advanced AI technologies in a
practical agricultural context, addressing environmental challenges while
improving agricultural productivity.

5665,2025-04-03 07:18:38.258,"In the field of sports injury prediction, there are two directions of research: wearable device application and machine learning model development. Commercial systems such as Catapult Sports have been widely used in top leagues such as the NBA and the Premier League, using GPS and accelerometers to detect the load of athletes. (Rossi et al., 2018) Smart bracelets such as WHOOP monitor the physical load of athletes by wearing them to help athletes avoid fatigue caused by overtraining during training, thereby improving sports performance, recovery and health status. (Lopez et al., 2020) In academic research, the use of random forest algorithms and DWT in testing can identify athletes' injury tendencies and has high test accuracy. (Chen et al., 2023). And the progress of fatigue caused by exercise can be monitored through LSTM and CNN prediction models. (Zhang et al., 2022)

Although there has been some progress in preventing injuries to players through equipment and models. However, there are still obvious shortcomings in the solution. First, when GPS devices monitor movements, the sampling frequency is insufficient, which will lead to peak load troughs and miss the risk of ACL injury (Boyd, L. 2023). Secondly, the model data refers too much to biomechanical characteristics such as heart rate and gait, but ignores multiple factors such as psychological load and sleep quality. As a result, 70% of the predictive factors have not been discovered (Claudino et al., 2019). Secondly, ""the black box model leads to a crisis of trust in the clinical team and increases the risk of misdiagnosis by 37% (Rudin, 2019, p. 209)."" Finally, only 12% of professional teams will predict the results to the training management system (Düking, P., et al. 2021).

These factors make it impossible for players to maintain a healthy body. Therefore, accurate monitoring-trusted decision-making and intelligent intervention can be used as a novel development point. First, by integrating high-precision multimodal sensors and ultrasonic wearable devices to monitor the micro-injury of athletes' muscles during exercise, we can better understand which muscles of the athletes are injured, and add AI chips to analyze which part of the load exceeds the standard during exercise.

Professional sports are facing a severe sports injury crisis. Data show that more than 36% of NBA players and 28% of Premier League players suffer preventable sports injuries each year (Notebaert et al., 2020; McCall et al., 2022), which directly causes clubs to lose an average of 45 million pounds per year (Vollestad et al., 2020), and increases the risk of early retirement for young athletes by three times (Müller and Fuchs, 2022). Existing solutions have significant flaws - 70% of injury predictors (such as mental load) are ignored (Claudino et al., 2019), and generally rely on post-treatment (Gagg and Gomez, 2023). This study proposes an artificial intelligence prevention system that achieves an injury prediction accuracy of 92% by integrating high-precision biomechanical monitoring and cognitive load analysis, and is expected to significantly reduce expenditures in the global sports medical system (Marshall et al., 2020).

Related Work

There are two main research directions in the field of sports injury prediction: wearable device application and machine learning model development. In terms of commercial application, systems such as Catapult Sports have achieved 83% club coverage in top leagues such as the NBA and the Premier League by integrating GPS (sampling frequency 10Hz) and accelerometer (±16g range) technology (Rossi et al., 2018). Smart bracelets such as WHOOP use PPG sensors and heart rate variability analysis to successfully reduce overtraining-related injuries by 27% (Lopez et al., 2020). At the academic research level, the random forest algorithm combined with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has a prediction accuracy of 85.2% (95%CI: 82.1-88.3) for ACL injury tendency (Chen et al., 2023), and the LSTM-CNN hybrid model has an AUC of 0.91 in sports fatigue monitoring (Zhang et al., 2022).

Business Model

This project primarily serves three core markets: professional sports clubs, college sports programs, and wearable device manufacturers. In terms of professional clubs, top league teams such as the NBA and NFL invest more than $2 million in sports technology each year, and our solutions can save them 35% of their medical expenses, an average of $3.2 million per season. In the field of college sports, the 1,100 member schools of the NCAA league spend $1.1 billion on sports science each year, and our technology can help increase the success rate of draft picks by 28%. For equipment manufacturers, integrating our AI chips can increase the unit price of products by $200, giving them a competitive advantage in the global $12 billion sports wear market.

For professional clubs, our system can not only reduce medical costs (Marshall et al., 2020), but also increase the winning rate by 12.7% by optimizing player efficiency (McCall et al., 2022). College athletes can reduce the risk of injury by 42% and significantly improve their draft prospects. Equipment manufacturers can quickly upgrade their products through technology licensing ($15/device). More importantly, our solution establishes a complete closed loop of ""prevention-monitoring-intervention"", which is an advanced model currently adopted by only 12% of professional teams (Düking et al., 2021).

The beneficiaries of this technology are: First, the team management: improve the team's performance and reduce medical expenses through the use of equipment and technology. Second, the coaching staff: can arrange players for reasonable rotation and training through analysis. Third, team doctors and physiotherapists: pay attention to the medical accuracy and interpretability of the system. Finally, athletes: they can keep themselves healthy and in good competitive state, so that they can win more wages and longer careers through better performance. The technology brought by data science will surely bring revolutionary changes to sports. At the same time, it can also allow more people to bring healthier bodies to ordinary sports enthusiasts or fitness people through the creativity brought by this data science.

Similarly, a study by NYC Data Science Academy (2020) leveraged various classification algorithms to predict match results but lacked consideration of external factors like player fatigue and weather conditions (NYC Data Science Academy, 2020).

In another study, researchers from IEEE (2022) explored deep learning techniques for sports analytics, demonstrating the potential of neural networks in predicting match outcomes. Despite achieving promising results, the model required extensive computational resources and lacked transparency in decision-making (IEEE, 2022). Furthermore, a review by Atlantis Press (2021) highlighted the need for improved feature engineering, suggesting that existing approaches often rely on limited data points that do not capture the full complexity of match dynamics (Atlantis Press, 2021).

Despite these advances, significant gaps remain. Most models fail to balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, making it challenging for users to understand and trust the predictions. Additionally, real-time data integration remains an underdeveloped aspect of current predictive models, limiting their applicability in live match scenarios. Our project aims to address these gaps by developing a model that not only improves accuracy but also enhances interpretability and real-time adaptability.

By leveraging insights from existing research and incorporating novel techniques, our approach seeks to contribute to the growing field of sports analytics, providing a more reliable and practical solution for predicting tennis match outcomes.

A study by Pillai (2021) developed a predictive model using player statistics and match conditions. While it achieved moderate success, it lacked real-time adaptability and model transparency, which limits its use in live match scenarios and strategic applications (Pillai, 2021). Similarly, a project by NYC Data Science Academy (2020) tested various classification models but overlooked dynamic factors like player fatigue, momentum shifts, or changing match conditions, which are crucial in close or extended matches.










An IEEE study (2022) applied deep learning for sports action evaluation, demonstrating potential for high-accuracy predictions. However, its black-box nature made it difficult for end-users (e.g., coaches, analysts) to interpret or trust the model’s decisions. This lack of explainability is a common issue in neural networks, especially when used in high-stakes contexts like betting or player strategy planning.










A systematic review by Atlantis Press (2021) further emphasized the shortcomings of current models, particularly in feature engineering. Many models rely on basic statistics and fail to incorporate nuanced, match-specific attributes—such as performance by surface or recent form—which reduces the model’s ability to generalize across diverse match conditions.










These studies inform the foundation of our project but also highlight critical research gaps:




	•	Lack of real-time data integration makes most models unsuitable for live decision-making.




	•	Poor interpretability limits trust and usability for strategic planning or broadcasting.




	•	Narrow feature sets miss important contextual variables like surface-specific stats, player fatigue, and recent momentum.










Our proposed project addresses these issues by:




	•	Engineering a rich set of features including surface win rates, serve/return efficiencies, and recent performance trends




	•	Applying interpretable models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) alongside more complex ones (e.g., random forest) for a balance between accuracy and transparency




	•	Designing the model pipeline with real-time integration potential, making it adaptable for live-match scenarios in the future










In summary, this project builds upon existing research by combining best practices in predictive modeling with a more comprehensive, surface-aware, and interpretable framework—bringing us closer to practical, real-world applications in tennis analytics.

1. Introduction

Predicting tennis match outcomes remains a complex yet highly valuable problem within the domain of sports analytics. Numerous factors influence match results, including surface type, historical player performance, physical fatigue, and head-to-head records. Despite the growing use of machine learning (ML) in this domain, many existing models suffer from limitations such as inadequate feature selection, low interpretability, and lack of integration with real-time data (Pillai, 2022). These limitations reduce the accuracy and trustworthiness of predictions, particularly in high-stakes scenarios such as betting and coaching.

This project proposes a machine learning framework that addresses these limitations by focusing on interpretable and scalable predictive models tailored for ATP tennis. The model aims to enhance prediction reliability by incorporating advanced feature engineering, such as surface-specific win rates, recent player form, serve/return performance, and head-to-head statistics. A blend of interpretable algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) and ensemble techniques (e.g., random forests) will be employed, with future potential for integration with live data streams via APIs.

The project’s goal is to deliver a model that not only predicts outcomes with high accuracy but also provides clear reasoning behind predictions. This will make it valuable for diverse stakeholders, including sports analysts, coaches, bettors, fantasy sports users, and media broadcasters. By addressing identified gaps in current approaches, the project contributes to more reliable, actionable, and transparent analytics in professional tennis.",Student

2. Related Work

Machine learning has been increasingly applied to tennis outcome prediction, yet notable challenges remain. Pillai (2022) developed a model based on basic player statistics and match conditions. While the model demonstrated moderate accuracy, it lacked flexibility and explainability—two essential qualities for practical use by coaches or bettors.

A project by the NYC Data Science Academy (2022) tested multiple classification algorithms, including logistic regression and support vector machines, but failed to account for critical match-context variables such as fatigue and player momentum. These omissions limited the model’s real-world relevance, particularly in competitive match settings.

More advanced efforts, such as the IEEE (2021) study on deep learning in sports analytics, yielded impressive prediction accuracy. However, the black-box nature of deep learning restricted interpretability and hindered adoption in real-world coaching or betting environments where transparency is essential. Similarly, Atlantis Press (2021) emphasized the importance of nuanced feature engineering and criticized earlier models for ignoring surface-specific stats and recent player form.

In response to these limitations, this project focuses on:

	•	Incorporating underutilized yet critical features such as recent performance, surface preference, fatigue (proxied by recent match counts), and head-to-head records.

	•	Prioritizing interpretable models like decision trees and logistic regression to improve usability for non-technical stakeholders.

	•	Exploring integration pathways for real-time data updates, enabling dynamic prediction during live events.

This hybrid approach balances predictive performance with interpretability, offering a unique contribution to the field of tennis analytics.

However, despite increasing interest, significant gaps remain in current implementations.










Pillai (2022) introduced a basic predictive model using player statistics and contextual match features. While moderately successful, the model lacked flexibility and explainability—two critical aspects for stakeholders like coaches and bettors. Similarly, a project by the NYC Data Science Academy (2022) employed a variety of classification models, including logistic regression and support vector machines. However, the absence of match-context variables such as fatigue and player momentum significantly limited its predictive accuracy in real-world, competitive scenarios.










Deep learning models have also been explored. An IEEE study (2021) applied neural networks for tennis action evaluation and achieved commendable accuracy. However, the black-box nature of deep learning posed challenges for interpretability, making it less useful in domains where end-user trust and transparency are essential. Additionally, Atlantis Press (2021) emphasized the shortcomings of many existing approaches, particularly the lack of nuanced feature engineering—such as surface preferences and recent form trends—which are vital in a sport as situationally dependent as tennis.










To address these shortcomings, the present project proposes a hybrid approach:




	•	It emphasizes interpretable models such as decision trees and logistic regression, which are transparent and accessible for non-technical users.




	•	It incorporates underutilized performance indicators, including surface-specific win rates, fatigue (based on recent match load), and serve-return efficiency.




	•	The project also explores integration pathways for real-time data via APIs or sensor-based feeds, enabling match-aware prediction updates.










Moreover, recent advances in sports data acquisition—such as Hawk-Eye Live and player wearables—have made real-time analytics more feasible (ATP Tour, 2023). These technologies can enhance data quality and refresh frequency, further supporting the model’s potential for live deployment and strategic in-game adaptation.

",Student
5730,2025-04-02 23:25:23.812,"When comparing logistic regression and random forests for detecting credit card fraud, there are several key distinctions to consider:

1. **Complexity and Interpretability:**
   - **Logistic Regression:** This is a simpler and more interpretable model, making it easier to understand how predictions are made. It's suited for datasets with a linear decision boundary.
   - **Random Forests:** This ensemble-based model combines multiple decision trees to make predictions, offering higher complexity and potentially better performance on non-linear datasets. However, it can be less interpretable.

2. **Performance:**
   - **Logistic Regression:** Tends to perform well when the relationship between input features and the target variable is approximately linear. It may struggle with complex decision boundaries.
   - **Random Forests:** Often provides higher accuracy compared to logistic regression, especially on complex datasets like those involved in fraud detection due to its ability to capture complex patterns.

3. **Handling Imbalances:**
   - **Logistic Regression:** May require additional techniques like oversampling/undersampling to handle class imbalance effectively.
   - **Random Forests:** Naturally better at dealing with imbalanced datasets due to the voting mechanism among trees, though performance can still be improved with balancing techniques.

4. **Overfitting:**
   - **Logistic Regression:** Generally less prone to overfitting, though it can still occur if too many features are used.
   - **Random Forests:** Can mitigate overfitting through averaging predictions across many trees, but may require tuning of hyperparameters like the number of trees.

For detecting credit card fraud, random forests might offer better accuracy and flexibility at the cost of increased computational requirements, making them a strong choice if the primary goal is maximizing detection rates with lower false positives.",Chatbot

Several fraud detection systems are currently being used in the industry, largely relying on rule-based engines, supervised machine learning and anomaly detetcion. Rule-based systems, are widely used in traditional banking, the transactions are flagged based on a set threshold. These result in high false positive rates (Citation). Major institutions like American Express and Visa rely on models like logistic regression, decision trees and neural networks (Citation). There are 3rd party AI Tools such as SAS Fraud Management and FICO falcon these integrate AI with analytics to provide scalable solutions for multiple financial institutions(Citation), which result in access to a huge dataset for training.

 

There are several limitations in the current approaches to this problem, Since fradulent transactions have a highly imbalanced data, very few data related to fradulent transactions to mimic real time scenario, it leads to systems being biased towards predicting legitimate transactions.

1. Introduction




Problem Statement: This project
     focuses on predicting sudden changes between different market volatility
     states (e.g., switching from low volatility to high volatility) for
     financial assets. The goal is to build an accurate classification model
     that estimates the probability of these shifts happening in the near
     future (e.g., next trading day, next week) while being interpretable,
     going beyond simply forecasting the level of future volatility.
Background and
     Context: Market volatility isn't steady; it changes over time, often staying
     high or low for extended periods before switching. Current risk management
     methods often rely on past data (like historical volatility) or use
     complex statistical models (like ARIMA or GARCH) that primarily predict
     future volatility levels. While useful, these methods often react slowly
     or don't clearly signal when the market is about to transition to a
     different volatility state. There's a growing need, especially with faster
     algorithmic trading, for clear, forward-looking tools that specifically
     predict these shifts.
Importance of the
     Problem: Unexpected volatility shifts are a major cause of large portfolio
     losses and trading strategy failures. Being unable to anticipate these
     changes leads to inefficient use of capital and exposure to avoidable
     risks. Developing reliable predictions for volatility state changes helps
     traders and firms adjust their risk proactively. It addresses a
     significant practical challenge in automated trading and risk management.
Specific Goals:
Clearly define
      distinct volatility states (e.g., ""Low,"" ""Medium,""
      ""High"") using standard statistical measures on historical
      market data.
Develop effective
      input features from readily available market data (OHLCV, technical
      indicators) that help predict the probability (confidence level) of the shift
      in volatility state in the near future.
Build and
      thoroughly evaluate several interpretable machine learning classification
      models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict the
      probability of entering each volatility state in the next period.
Achieve high
      predictive accuracy, particularly in identifying the less frequent but
      critical transitions to high volatility, using metrics like F1-Score, ROC
      AUC, and Precision/Recall.
Provide clear
      model outputs, including the predicted probabilities and explanations for
      the predictions (e.g., using feature importance analysis), making the
      results understandable and trustworthy.




2. Related Work




Summary of
     Existing Approaches: Common methods include: calculating Historical
     Volatility (backward-looking); using GARCH models (forecast volatility
     levels, complex); using Implied Volatility from options (market
     expectation, not available for all assets); and using technical indicators
     like ATR (reactive). Some research uses complex neural networks (LSTMs),
     which can be powerful but often difficult to interpret (hard to know why
     they make a specific prediction) and require large datasets and computing
     power.
Identification of
     Gaps: There is a need for practical, interpretable models that specifically
     focus on classifying upcoming volatility state changes. GARCH focuses on
     levels, Implied Volatility reflects market opinion, indicators lag, and
     complex deep learning models can lack the transparency needed for critical
     risk decisions. Using interpretable machine learning techniques for
     predicting volatility state shifts could potentially achieve practical result
     while also offering interpretability.
Novelty and
     Contribution: This project takes a distinct approach by treating volatility shift
     prediction as a classification problem solvable with interpretable machine
     learning models using highly available data (OHLCV). Its novelty comes
     from:
Directly
      Targeting Shifts: The model's primary goal is to predict the probability
      of change of volatility state, not just the predicted future level.
Emphasis on
      Interpretability: Using models where the prediction logic can be
      examined and understood is key for risk management trust and validation,
      unlike some highly complex alternatives.
Practicality: Using readily
      available data and standard ML models makes the solution easier to
      implement and maintain.




3. Business Model




Business/Application
     Area: This project fits within Financial Technology (FinTech), specifically
     providing Tools for Automated Risk Control and Decision Aids for Automated
     Trading or even classic Manual Trading. It offers valuable predictive
     information for quantitative trading teams, hedge funds, asset managers,
     risk departments, and developers of trading software.
Role of Data and
     Value Creation: The project uses historical market data (prices, indicators, volume)
     to create forward-looking predictions. Data is analysed to find patterns
     that signal upcoming changes in volatility. The value comes from turning
     this historical data into a probability estimate of future volatility
     shifts, allowing users to act before changes happen, rather than just
     reacting. Key benefits include:
Better Protection
      Against Losses: Reduced risk exposure by adjusting positions
      before volatility increases unexpectedly.
Smarter Use of
      Trading Capital: Adjusting position sizes based on predicted
      volatility can improve risk-adjusted returns.
Making Trading
      Strategies More Robust: Adapting strategy rules (like stop-loss levels)
      based on expected volatility makes them perform better across different
      market conditions.
Improving
      Decisions with Data: Offers probabilities to help guide trading and
      risk decisions, which can help to estimate risk-adjusted returns more accurately.
Interpretable: Provides useful
      information such as feature importance that could reveal hidden insights
      from the training data.

      Analysts (Quants): Need reliable predictive inputs for building
      and improving automated trading systems. This model provides a
      probabilistic based prediction which can also be used to estimate the risk-adjusted
      returns.

Government subsidies are a major instrument to stabilize food production, enhance farm income, and reduce vulnerability to food shortages. However, the effectiveness of these subsidies is often disconnected from environmental realities, yield volatility, and transnational shortages. 

Climate change has intensified weather unpredictability, causing stress on food systems across countries. Rainfall variability, prolonged droughts, and extreme temperatures result in yield instability. While countries use subsidies to buffer these effects, they are not always optimized or directed towards climate-resilient outcomes. Furthermore, fertilizer and pesticide subsidies can be environmentally unsustainable when misaligned with actual need. 

Recent reports from the FAO (2022) show that more than 800 million people remain food insecure globally, and this number is expected to rise under continued climate volatility.

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Problem Statement**:  
Despite significant investments in agricultural subsidies and concerns over climate change, no integrated model exists to measure food security by linking these domains. Current methods analyze subsidy effectiveness and climate impact in isolation, contributing to yield instability and regional food shortages without cohesive policy interventions. Furthermore, the absence of a scalable system for cross-country coordination when facing surpluses and deficits necessitates a new approach. Existing subsidy schemes for fertilizers and pesticides often neglect regional environmental conditions and long-term sustainability. This project aims to develop a subsidy-aware food security model that incorporates climate stress, yield trends, and policy inputs to inform national and international strategies.

**1.2 Background and Context**:  
Food security remains a pressing global issue due to agricultural production fluctuations, unpredictable weather, and policy misalignments. Subsidy policies often influence crop types and distribution but fail to consider ecological impacts, leading to compromised productivity under changing climate conditions. Despite subsidies stabilizing farm income, they fall short if they ignore environmental risks. The situation is exacerbated by climate change, which disrupts planting cycles through temperature extremes and rainfall variability. Integrating subsidy mechanisms with environmental data is vital for long-term food system stability.

**1.3 Importance**:  
This issue affects economic stability and human welfare. Food-insecure nations face price shocks, political unrest, and poverty, impacting regions like Africa and the Middle East. The global relevance and urgency of integrated strategies are underscored by examples such as Australia's low subsidies and high yield volatility. A data-driven model can provide evidence-based policy reform, optimize resource allocation, and support climate-resilient agriculture. Cross-country collaboration can enhance global food distribution and stabilize prices, making such a model a powerful decision-support tool.

**2. Related Work**

**2.1 Existing Research**:  
Research has primarily focused on subsidies improving crop yield and income stability, with limited studies on their interaction with climate change and yield instability. Literature on cross-border food system modeling lacks a strategy-centric view combining climate vulnerability with subsidy efficiency and mutual support planning.

**2.2 Gaps in Current Approaches**:  
The OECD outlines producer support estimates but misses links to climate resilience. Meanwhile, FAO reports climate-induced production losses without policy modeling solutions.

**2.3 Novelty of Your Approach**:  
This project introduces:
- Integration of subsidy policies, climate indicators, and yield variability for comprehensive food security assessment.
- A novel Food Security Score employing PCA and clustering.
- A cross-border crop exchange strategy based on real-time surpluses and deficits.
- Identification of inefficient subsidy policies using real environmental impact data.
- Multi-country data insights, with particular relevance to Australia’s low-subsidy, high-risk climate model.

In today’s
hyper-connected world, the growing dependence has given rise to a psychological
condition known as digital burnout—a state of mental exhaustion caused by
prolonged interaction with digital devices and platforms. This condition is
marked by fatigue, reduced motivation, anxiety, and cognitive overload, often
stemming from excessive smartphone use. The constant stream of information, app
switching, and notifications places the brain in a sustained state of
stimulation, leading to mental fatigue and decreased overall well-being.





The effects of digital
burnout are wide-ranging. Studies show strong links between prolonged screen
time and poor sleep quality, academic underperformance, and mental health
issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression. Certain groups, including
university students, remote workers, and young adults, are particularly
vulnerable due to high reliance on digital tools for work, learning, and social
interaction. Overuse not only disrupts sleep and productivity but can also
diminish real-world social engagement, leading to isolation.

has been measured using self-reported surveys, which can be biased and
infrequent. However, app usage data offers an objective and continuous
alternative for identifying burnout-related behavior. Indicators such as total
screen time, night-time app usage, and frequent app switching can serve as digital
biomarkers of burnout. These behavioral features can be analyzed using
time-series or machine learning techniques to support early detection.

**Introduction:**

As the global population ages, the prevalence of cognitive disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease continues to rise, placing immense strain on healthcare systems and families alike. Recent estimates suggest that by 2050, the number of individuals aged 60 years and older will exceed two billion. In aged care facilities, residents often experience accelerated cognitive decline due to social isolation and insufficient mental stimulation. 

To address this pressing issue, innovative solutions leveraging technology are needed. This project explores the application of advanced conversational AI, integrating General Turn-taking Models and Large Language Models (LLMs), to provide elderly care residents with continuous cognitive engagement. By employing these cutting-edge models, the proposed system aims to facilitate meaningful dialogues with residents, potentially slowing the progression of cognitive decline and enhancing the quality of life.

In particular, this solution will utilize a Furhat robotic platform, adapted to understand conversational dynamics such as pauses and interruptions, and to engage proactively with users. The goal is to create a companion that not only supports daily social interactions but also targets conversations that can help maintain cognitive health.

5817,2025-04-04 11:56:02.079,"Over the past decades, numerous efforts have been made to increase social activities and interactions in aged care facilities. This trend is driven by a growing understanding of the negative impact of social loneliness on the mental and physical health of older adults, which can increase the risk of depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, and accelerated memory deterioration (Donovan & Blazer, 2020).

Social interaction has been shown to yield positive outcomes, including improved well-being, enhanced quality of life, and reduced levels of depression and cognitive decline (Aroogh & Shahboulaghi, 2020). In response, aged care workers have implemented various strategies to foster social connection among older adults in care homes. These include group-based programs, community-based activities, and, more recently, the use of assistive technologies. Despite these ongoing efforts, sustaining regular and meaningful interactions in aged care remains a challenge due to limited staffing, time constraints, and the unique needs of each individual (Kagan, 2024).

Driven by advancements in chatbots (Khamaj, 2025) and conversational AI (Chiddarwar, 2025) and the growing need for social interaction in aged care, this project aims to utilise data science—particularly large language models (LLMs) and conversational AI—tailored specifically for the aged care context, with a focus on natural turn-taking in conversations. The system will integrate a fine-tuned LLM with a turn-taking-based AI model, embodied in a robot (Skantze & Irfan, 2025), to create an agent specialised in engaging in socially and emotionally aware conversations with older adults. Unlike traditional conversational AI systems, which often struggle with interruptions or long pauses—leading to confusion and a reduced user experience—this project emphasises natural turn-taking. This is particularly important in aged care, where older adults may take longer to respond or express themselves.

1. Introduction

In today's competitive gaming market, game live streaming has emerged as a powerful marketing channel to attract new players, influencing player awareness, interest, and purchase behavior. Live streaming platforms such as Twitch, YouTube Gaming, and Bilibili have become key marketing channels for games. 78% of game publishers now invest in streamer collaborations (Simon, 2023). R.E.P.O, a newly launched online-interactive game, has generated moderate initial interest, but typical streamer collaborations based primarily on viewer numbers have not focused audience conversion to players which means the marketing result is unknown.

This project aims to accurately predict moments of high positive audience sentiment, R.E.P.O's marketing team can deliver timely, tailored advertisements in these moments to attract downloads and purchases. Therefore to significantly increase player conversion and maximise marketing ROI.

The primary goal is to build a sentiment-based real-time predictive model that enables marketing operations to capitalize on peak audience interest moments through targeted advertising strategies, therefore to increase conversion rate.

2. Related Work

In the game industry, companies widely engage popular streamers and video makers to promote new content releases. For instance, miHoYo has provided financial rewards to creators who promote the game through videos or streams with collaboration-based incentive programs. Similarly, indie game studios often send early-access keys to streamers to create pre-release buzz. Sjöblom and Hamari (2017) found direct correlations between streamers' interactions, audience sentiment, and viewer retention.

However, current practices remain largely superficial, emphasizing total viewership over engagement quality. Existing research lacks quantitative, real-time approaches linking audience sentiment directly to marketing outcomes like conversions or in-game purchases. The absence of real-time sentiment-driven advertising strategies represents a significant gap in current gaming marketing methodologies.

This project fills this gap by extracting audience sentiment polarity and game-specific intent signals, using machine learning to analyse predictively to establish real-time correlations between livestream interactions and player conversion metrics, enabling precisely timed advertising.

3. Business Model

This project aligns with the marketing and user acquisition strategies of game development companies, particularly those promoting new titles with limited initial traction. For R.E.P.O’s publisher, livestream-based marketing represents a cost-effective, scalable, and data-rich channel. 

Business value includes:

Real-time Marketing Optimization: Identify optimal advertising moments based on live audience sentiment, maximizing immediate player conversion rates.

Personalized Advertisement Delivery: Tailor promotional content dynamically according to real-time viewer sentiment, enhancing message relevance and effectiveness.

Enhanced ROI from Influencer Partnerships: Focus partnerships on streamers generating the highest real-time audience positivity, maximizing marketing efficiency.

Stakeholders:

Marketing teams: Gain insights into real-time campaign effectiveness, enabling swift adjustments and optimized budget allocation.

Community managers: Identify and support streamers whose audiences consistently exhibit strong positive sentiment toward the game.

Product teams: monitor gameplay contents that drive the most interest.

Challenges:

While the project offers substantial value, several practical limitations should be considered when interpreting the results or applying them in business decision-making:

Sentiment Analysis Accuracy: Real-time natural language processing may face challenges such as slang, emojis, and context-specific phrases.

Cross-platform Generalizability: Audience behavior variations across platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and Bilibili may require platform-specific model adjustments.

Ultimately, this project aims to establish a robust, sentiment-driven marketing model, significantly enhancing player acquisition efficiency for R.E.P.O.

(2018), the term ""cascade"" refers to a process in which a piece of information spreads through a network, such as social media, from one user to another. Here's a bit more detail on what cascades involve:

1. **Data Cascades**: A cascade begins when one person shares a piece of information, such as a news article, on a social media platform. If others decide to share or retweet this information, these actions contribute to the growth of the cascade.

2. **Measurement**: Cascades are often measured in terms of depth (how many times the information gets reshared in series), breadth (how widely it spreads), and the overall size (total spread or reach).

3. **True vs. False News**: In their study, Vosoughi and colleagues compared cascades of true and false news stories. They found that false news cascades tend to be larger, deeper, and wider than those of true news.

4. **Significance of Cascades**: Understanding cascades is crucial for analyzing the spread of information through social networks as it directly relates to virality and influence. This is particularly important in studies about misinformation, where false news can quickly reach a significant audience through expansive cascades.

5849,2025-03-30 23:33:23.988,"Echo chambers are a crucial concept when considering the spread of information, including fake news, in social networks:

1. **Definition**: An echo chamber is a digital or social environment where individuals encounter beliefs or opinions that mirror and reinforce their own. This is typically facilitated by algorithms that suggest content based on past behavior or by deliberate choice of communities that share similar viewpoints.

2. **Dynamics**: Within these environments, dissenting opinions or contradictory facts are less likely to be encountered. This reinforcement loop can magnify the perception of support for a particular view or piece of information, leading to stronger convictions among members.

3. **Impact on Fake News**: In the context of fake news, echo chambers are significant because they can enhance the virality of false information. Users within an echo chamber may repeatedly interact with misinformation, giving it more visibility and credibility.

4. **Role in Cascades**: Echo chambers can contribute to the formation of larger and more persistent cascades for misinformation by continuously spreading content among like-minded users.

5. **Challenges**: Dealing with echo chambers poses challenges for efforts to curb misinformation since it requires breaking the cycle of reinforced belief and encouraging exposure to diverse perspectives.

In the scope of your project on predicting the virality of fake news, considering the role of echo chambers could provide valuable insights into why certain content spreads more effectively and how these networks can be influenced or managed.

It sounds like an interesting use case to have a system that alerts you when the soil is dry, but you don't need to water because it will rain in a few hours. This is another great Data Science application in agriculture.

Application of Data Science in Agriculture

Data Science applications in agriculture are diverse, from precision farming to livestock management. Perhaps one of the most promising applications is in the area of precision farming. By collecting data on factors such as weather, soil conditions, and plant growth, farmers can better understand how to optimize their crop yields. Here are some applications of Data Science in agriculture:  

1. Digital Soil and Crop Mapping

The application of Data Science in agriculture is abundant. Data Science can be used to map out digital soil and crops. This information can be used by farmers to make more efficient use of their land and by agronomists to better understand the needs of crops. In addition, Data Science can be used to predict weather patterns and forecast crop yields. By applying Data Science to agriculture, we can increase yields, reduce costs, and improve the quality of our food supply. 

2. Weather Prediction to Improve Yield

Data Science is helping farmers to predict weather patterns and forecast crop yields with increasing accuracy. In the past, farmers would make decisions based on their experience and intuition about the weather. However, this approach is often inaccurate, leading to poor crop yields and financial losses. With Data Science, farmers can now access historical data and use it to identify patterns in weather patterns. This information can then be used to make more informed decisions about when to plant crops and how to care for them. As a result, Data Science is helping to improve crop yields and reduce financial risks for farmers. In the future, Data Science is likely to play an even bigger role in agriculture as more data becomes available and algorithms become more sophisticated. 

3. Fertilizers Recommendation

Data Science is the study of extracting insights from large datasets. In recent years, it has been successfully applied in a wide range of fields, from medicine to marketing. Now, Data Science is beginning to revolutionize agriculture. Farmers are using Data Science to optimize everything from irrigation to fertilizer use. By analyzing large datasets, data scientists can identify patterns that would be difficult to spot with the naked eye. As a result, farmers are able to make more informed decisions about how to best care for their crops. 


4. Disease Detection and Pest Management

Data Science has a huge range of applications in the agricultural sector. One of the most important applications is in disease detection and pest management. By analyzing data on crop growth, climate, and soil conditions, data scientists can develop models that can predict when and where diseases are likely to occur. This information can then be used to develop targeted pest management strategies that can minimize crop damage. Additionally, by analyzing large data sets on historical crop yields, data scientists can help farmers to optimize their planting and harvesting schedules to maximize yields.   

5. Adaptation to Climate Change

Data Science is helping farmers to adapt to climate change in a number of ways. Perhaps most importantly, Data Science provides farmers with new insights into how plants respond to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. By understanding how plants respond to current conditions, farmers can adjust their growing practices to help crops flourish under future conditions. In addition, Data Science is being used to develop new varieties of crops that are better suited to a changing climate. By identifying the traits that enable plants to thrive in different conditions, plant breeders can create new varieties that are more resilient to the effects of climate change. As a result, Data Science is increasingly important in helping agriculture adapt to a changing climate. 

6. Automated Irrigation System

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing agriculture today. With the world's population expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050, farmers will need to produce more food than ever before. At the same time, climate change is making it more difficult to grow crops and raising the risk of crop failure. As a result, agricultural productivity must increase by up to 60% by 2050 in order to meet global demand. Data Science can play a key role in helping farmers adapt to climate change. By tracking data on weather patterns, soil moisture, and crop yields, data scientists can help farmers make better decisions about when to plant, how much water to use, and what crops to grow.

In this article, we’ll explore the green world of agriculture and understand its importance for local and global communities. We’ll learn the different data types involved, as well as the needed skills for you to become a data scientist in this field – including what kind of tasks you might do regularly. We’ll also look at the real-life applications of big data in agriculture.


Introduction to Agriculture

While countries like Qatar and Andorra rely mostly on industry to drive growth, agriculture represents the lifeblood of many nations such as Liberia and Somalia. For them, agriculture accounts for as high as 70% of the country’s GDP. Based on this, we can safely say that it is as critical for communities as healthcare. But what is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of agriculture? For most people, it’s the harvest of fruits or vegetables, isn’t it? But this is actually a common misconception – that kind of produce is just a small sliver of what the practice deals with. Agriculture is both an art and a science. It’s considered one of the oldest professions in the world. In ancient times, the only tools provided to grow crops were water (to irrigate lands) and fire (to control the growth of some plants). However, over time, farmers developed new tools and techniques to increase productivity. Now we can see entire farms where data science plays an astounding role in managing the process. 

What Are the Types of Data Used in Agriculture?

Soil Data: This type of data is collected both manually and with equipment that farmers use to analyze small samples of soil to determine its properties. There are many soil parameters, most of which are analyzed chemically. 

Yield Data: Yield mapping data is collected using equipment that collects geo-referenced information which agriculturists can use to check the harvested crops and define the problematic areas through digital maps. In simpler terms, this type of data in agriculture helps farmers assess their land visually, as well as monitor performance and productivity.

Weather Data: With the technological advancement of the 21st century, weather data is now collected by sensors in weather stations. What does this mean for agriculture? As previously mentioned, farmers need to be always aware of weather conditions throughout the year as this helps them asses how their harvest will grow. For example, using this type of information, they can decide the right temperature for each crop and the right time to apply pesticides since weather data can help predict pests and diseases on crops.

What Are the Applications of Data Science in Agriculture?

Farmers benefit from data-driven agriculture when making decisions for their land. More specifically, with the huge amounts of data generated every day, they depend on AI systems to provide them with actionable insights in order to increase yield and detect problems beforehand. Each company uses data science according to the available human and material resources. It’s important to remember that you need various equipment to collect the required data. To keep it short, these are the most common applications of data science in agriculture:

Predicting weather conditions such as rainfall, wind speed, and relative humidity.
Detecting diseases using algorithms that can identify specific patterns in crop images.
Automating the process of irrigation with the help of weather prediction to help rationalize water consumption.
Recognizing different plant species using deep learning techniques such as CNN on leaf vein patterns.
Managing resources like energy, water, and pesticides using AI insights.         remember it",Student

5878,2025-04-03 12:50:07.213,"Multisource Data Integration for Crop Recommendation Based on Market Value and Environmental Suitability

1. Introduction

In modern agriculture, farmers face the complex challenge of selecting the right crop to plant in a changing environment. This challenge stems from the growing variability in climate, unpredictable weather events, soil degradation, and fluctuating market prices. Traditionally, crop selection decisions have relied on farmer experience or historical norms rather than objective, data-driven analysis, leading to missed economic opportunities and suboptimal land use.

The agricultural sector represents a vital component of many developing and emerging economies. In some countries, agriculture contributes up to 70% of GDP, making crop performance critical to both food security and economic stability(How to Become a Data Scientist in Agriculture, 2022). However, while data science has been successfully applied to optimize yield or predict pest outbreaks, there remains a critical gap in tools that connect environmental conditions with real-time market data to inform strategic planting decisions.

This project aims to address that gap by developing a crop recommendation system that integrates three types of data: (1) soil characteristics (e.g., pH, NPK levels), (2) weather data (historical and forecasted), and (3) local market prices of agricultural commodities. Using machine learning models in R, the system will forecast expected yield and market value for various crops in a specific location and season. The ultimate goal is to recommend the most suitable and profitable crops for planting, reducing financial risk and promoting sustainable farming.

2. Related Work

Numerous researchers have leveraged data science to enhance various aspects of agriculture. Kulkarni introduced an ensemble model using Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM to recommend crops based on soil and climate data, achieving over 99% accuracy(Kulkarni et al., 2018). Rajak used Naive Bayes and k-NN for crop yield prediction based on soil behavior(Rajak et al., n.d.). Similarly, the crop recommendation system proposed by Pudumalar aimed at improving yield through extensible prediction frameworks(Pudumalar et al., 2017).

However, many of these systems focus primarily on yield maximization or environmental suitability alone. Liu and Yu explored grain price forecasting using linear regression, ANN, and LSTM, indicating the importance of price modeling(Liu & Yu, 2019). Devalkar emphasize the need for integrating diverse data sources but highlight the operational challenges in doing so(Devalkar et al., 2018). Moreover, while data scientists in DATAFOREST discuss sensor-based monitoring and climate resilience, they rarely consider dynamic price signals in crop choice(Data Science in Agriculture in 2024, n.d.).

The novelty of this project lies in its multisource integration of both agronomic and economic variables to drive crop selection. It is not just about predicting yield or classifying crops based on soil; it is about making economically intelligent recommendations by forecasting both productivity and market return, a dimension underrepresented in current literature and tools.

3. Business Model

The project serves a diverse customer base, including smallholder farmers, agricultural cooperatives, agri-tech platforms, and policymakers. Smallholder farmers benefit from data-informed crop recommendations that help reduce uncertainty and increase profitability. Agricultural cooperatives and agribusinesses gain access to scalable insights for managing procurement, planning logistics, and guiding advisory services. Government agencies and NGOs can use the system to support food security planning, resource allocation, and subsidy targeting. Channels to reach these customers include web dashboards, mobile apps, SMS-based tools for areas with limited internet access, and integration with existing agri-tech platforms. Relationships will be supported through personalized recommendations, community engagement workshops, multilingual interfaces, and feedback loops to continuously improve model performance.

Value is created by enabling more efficient and profitable farming through data integration. By combining environmental data (e.g., soil pH, moisture, climate trends) with economic data (e.g., crop price forecasts), the system bridges the gap between agronomic feasibility and market opportunity. The anticipated benefits include: (1) improved decision-making for crop selection, (2) optimized use of land and inputs like fertilizer and water, (3) higher crop profitability based on dynamic pricing insights, (4) lower risk of loss due to poor crop choices, and (5) promotion of climate-resilient agriculture. From a sustainability perspective, recommending crops that match both ecological and market realities helps reduce waste, increase resilience, and support livelihoods across regions.

To enable this, the system relies on key resources such as multisource datasets (soil, weather, market), open-source modeling tools in R (`caret`, `randomForest`, `forecast`), and collaboration with agricultural researchers and data providers. Activities include data preprocessing, model development, testing, and visualization for end-user delivery. Partnerships with weather and soil data providers, universities, and agricultural extension agencies will ensure model accuracy and adoption. Financially, the prototype is low-cost due to open-source tools and public data. Future revenue could come from freemium access for farmers, subscriptions for cooperatives, or licensing for agri-tech companies and government use. This sustainable, scalable business model ensures that both economic and environmental goals can be achieved through a unified, data-driven approach to crop planning.

5998,2025-04-03 06:52:56.391,"Artificial Intelligence in Overwatch: From Matchmaking to Monetization
1. Introduction

Competitive gaming is growing into an important part of innovation and revenue in the gaming industry. It has witnessed tremendous expansion and upgrade in recent years. At the forefront of this evolution is Overwatch, the one and only team-based online competitive game which has won the game of the year(2016). Despite its past glory, the dilemma of Overwatch in recent years exemplifies the complex obstacles confronting contemporary game developers. This paper talks about the integration of artificial intelligence data solutions in addressing three critical aspects of Overwatch and some more multiplayer online competitive games: matchmaking systems, monetization strategies and esports performance analytics.




The challenges multiplayer online competitive games like Overwatch face are complicated. Traditional matchmaking approaches based on the so-called Elo rating systems have proven inadequate for team-based games where individual skill must be balanced against team‘s average level(McDiffett, 2018). In the meanwhile,Overwatch’s transition to free-to-play models has created new challenges in monetization, thus requiring advanced algorithms to balance revenue generation and player satisfaction (Newham et al., 2022). These challenges are particularly acute in the esports ecosystem because it has to maintain the competitive integrity while maximizing audience interaction and commercial success at the same time. 




2. Related Work

Although this field's current research has achieved considerable advancements, there are still major gaps. Dong and his colleagues have demonstrated improvements in MOBA matchmaking algorithms, yet their approach fails to fully address the complexities of role-based team compositions(Dong et al., 2025). Existing monetization methods usually struggle to strike a balance between player experience and revenue growth. What’s more, more and more competing products like “Marvel Rivals” are coming to the market since Overwatch was launched 8 years ago. It is essential for Overwatch to upgrade its operational strategy to stay competitive in today’s market. Last but not least, the introduction of IBM's Watson system for esports analytics constitutes a notable advance. However, it concentrates on performance metrics rather than comprehensive ecosystem optimization(Shelton, 2021). As a matter of fact,  this model can be introduced to random player’s gaming performance analysis. These performance data can be used to balance the game itself to better attract players.




A recent research by Khir and his colleagues in esports engagement prediction demonstrates the growing sophistication of analytical approaches in multiplayer competitive gaming. Their research indicates that AI-driven solutions may greatly improve player experience and commercial outcomes, especially when paired with developments in physiological and performance measurements(Khir et al., 2024). The novelty of this approach lies in its integrated framework that addresses matchmaking, monetization and performance analytics at the same time. This integrated strategy marks a substantial departure from existing solutions that typically resolve these problems in isolation.




3. Business Model

The market for multiplayer competitive gaming offers special opportunities and difficulties from a business perspective. It is known to all that Overwatch turned from a buyout game into the free-to-play model with battle pass and paid skins to increase their revenue. The free-to-play model, while offering greater accessibility and bigger potential market access, requires sophisticated monetization strategies to ensure sustainability. This analysis indicates that AI-driven solutions can create value through multiple channels. Enhanced matchmaking systems improve player retention by delivering more satisfying competitive experiences, while optimized monetization algorithms can increase revenue without compromising player satisfaction. 




In multiplayer competitive gaming, the stakeholder landscape is complicated. While players enjoy greater match quality and more equitable advancement mechanisms, game publishers like Blizzard would like to gain more income and user retention. Better analytics support both audience engagement and competition integrity in the esports space. Melhart and his colleagues emphasize the significance of balancing these various stakeholder interests while maintaining ethical AI practices(Melhart et al., 2024).




This research impacts beyond Overwatch and other multiplayer competitive games. The frameworks created here might be used in both digital and real-world situations.The balance between user experience and business profits  also provides valuable guidance for other digital entertainment platforms and real-world team-work events. Stakeholder interests and ethical considerations must be carefully considered as well to increase the efficiency of this AI-driven system.




In conclusion, the system with AI-driven solutions in multiplayer competitive gaming will bring remarkable revolution to this industry. This system can provide lasting value for the gaming ecosystem by solving the combined-problem of matching, monetization and in-game performance analytics. The requirements of different stakeholders should be taken into account  in this system as well. Following research should focus on improving these methods and investigating their use in different situations.

1. Introduction
With the rise of short video platforms such as TikTok, content virality has become a key driver of user engagement and platform revenue. However, predicting whether a video will go viral before it is released remains a major challenge. Most advertising and recommendation systems rely on post-release performance metrics, missing the opportunity to make profit-oriented decisions.
This project proposes a machine learning-based virality prediction model that classifies whether a TikTok video is likely to go viral based on metadata available before release. Using structured features such as video length, creator verification status, content category, etc., the model will learn to identify key patterns that distinguish viral from non-viral content. This project adopts a binary classification approach for virality prediction, labeling videos with the top 25% of engagement as ""viral"". Engagement is mainly measured using likes, which is a strong and consistent proxy for user interaction. Alternatively, a weighted engagement score combining likes, comments, and shares can be constructed to reflect a wider range of user reactions. In addition to classification models, continuous virality scores can be constructed to support use cases that require more detailed ranking of content performance.
The main goal of this project is to provide a decision support tool that enables early content evaluation and targeted advertising, helping brands allocate advertising spend more effectively and supporting creators in optimizing their content strategies.
2. Related Work
Predicting content virality has been a well-studied topic on various social media platforms. Prior studies have explored engagement prediction using metadata, user behavior, and content features. For example, Bandari et al. (2012) studied how to predict the popularity of news articles using textual and temporal signals. On YouTube, Trzcinski and Rokita (2015) leveraged video thumbnails, titles, and uploader statistics to predict popularity. Similar studies on Twitter and Reddit (e.g., Zhang et al., 2018) applied machine learning techniques to predict the number of retweets and likes based on linguistic and temporal features.
In the context of TikTok, studies such as Ferreira et al. (2021) have analyzed the impact of video length, music selection, and hashtag usage on post-release performance metrics. However, a key limitation of these studies is that they rely on post-release data (e.g., views, likes, or shares), which makes them unsuitable for pre-release decision making.
This project addresses this issue by proposing a pre-release virality prediction model that specifically uses metadata and creator attributes available before a video is released. By constructing a binary “viral” label based on engagement percentiles, the model learns to classify content virality using only early indicators, enabling platforms and advertisers to make data-driven decisions before any user interaction occurs.
This forward-looking approach introduces a new application of supervised machine learning in the context of content strategy optimization, moving beyond descriptive or reactive analysis to actionable, anticipatory predictions.
3. Business Model Analysis

The proposed project is positioned at the intersection of content creation, influencer marketing, and digital advertising. TikTok’s monetization strategy depends heavily on the visibility and performance of user-generated content. By accurately predicting the viral potential of a video, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions that improve business outcomes.

Multiple stakeholders can benefit from the proposed system in different ways. Advertisers, who often have difficulty predicting ROI, can use the model to make more confident sponsorship decisions. Content creators may get early feedback on which videos are more likely to perform well. Platforms themselves can use virality scores to improve user retention by showing more engaging content early on.

Project Implementation Notes: To build and deploy this prediction system, several roles are essential. For example, a data engineer may be responsible for extracting and preparing metadata from sources such as the TikTok API. Meanwhile, a machine learning engineer will develop and validate classification models, while a data scientist will focus on designing virality scoring logic and assessing potential business impact. In addition, integration with the platform advertising system may require backend support.
Challenges may include handling noisy or imbalanced data, ensuring low latency for real-time predictions, and designing virality thresholds that align with business goals. Addressing these challenges is key to ensuring that the system can operate reliably and scale in real-world environments.",Student

Nevertheless, predicting a video's potential to become viral prior to its release remains a significant challenge. Current advertising and recommendation systems predominantly rely on post-release performance metrics, thereby missing opportunities to make profit-oriented decisions. 

This project proposes a machine learning-based model aimed at predicting the virality of TikTok videos before their release, utilizing pre-release metadata. The model will analyze structured features, including video length, creator verification status, and content category, to identify patterns that distinguish viral from non-viral content. It employs a binary classification approach to predict virality, considering videos in the top 25% of engagement as ""viral."" Engagement is primarily gauged using likes, supported by an alternative weighted engagement score that combines likes, comments, and shares. Beyond classification models, continuous virality scores will be developed to accommodate more nuanced content performance rankings. 

The primary objective of this project is to deliver a decision support tool that facilitates early content evaluation and targeted advertising, thereby enabling brands to allocate advertising budgets more effectively and helping creators refine their content strategies.

Content virality prediction has been extensively explored across various social media platforms. Previous research has investigated engagement prediction using metadata, user behavior, and content attributes. For instance, Bandari et al. (2012) examined the prediction of news article popularity through textual and temporal signals, while Trzcinski and Rokita (2015) utilized video thumbnails, titles, and uploader statistics to forecast YouTube video popularity. Similar studies on Twitter and Reddit (e.g., Zhang et al., 2018) have employed machine learning techniques to predict retweets and likes using linguistic and temporal features.

In the context of TikTok, studies such as Ferreira et al. (2021) have investigated the effects of video length, music selection, and hashtag usage on post-release performance metrics. However, these studies' reliance on post-release data (e.g., views, likes, or shares) limits their applicability for pre-release decision making. This project addresses this limitation by introducing a pre-release virality prediction model that utilizes only metadata and creator attributes available before video release. By constructing a binary “viral” label based on engagement percentiles, the model classifies content virality using early indicators, allowing platforms and advertisers to make informed decisions preemptively. This anticipatory approach represents a novel application of supervised machine learning, advancing from descriptive or reactive analyses to actionable predictions.

### Business Model Analysis
The proposed project stands at the intersection of content creation, influencer marketing, and digital advertising. TikTok’s monetization strategy significantly relies on the visibility and success of user-generated content. Accurate video viral potential predictions enable stakeholders to make insightful data-driven decisions, thereby enhancing business outcomes.

Various stakeholders can derive benefits from the system. Advertisers, who frequently struggle to predict ROI, can utilize the model to make more confident sponsorship decisions. Content creators may receive early feedback on their videos' prospective performance. The platform itself can leverage virality scores to enhance user retention by prioritizing more engaging content.

### Project Implementation Notes
The development and deployment of this predictive system necessitate several roles. A data engineer will extract and prepare metadata from sources like the TikTok API. Concurrently, a machine learning engineer will develop and validate classification models, while a data scientist will design virality scoring logic and evaluate potential business impacts. Additionally, integration with the platform's advertising system may require backend support.

Key challenges include managing noisy or imbalanced data, ensuring low latency for real-time prediction capabilities, and setting virality thresholds aligned with business goals. Overcoming these challenges is paramount to ensuring the system operates reliably and scales effectively in real-world environments.",Chatbot

In competitive multiplayer games, the matchmaking system plays a crucial role in shaping player experience and long-term engagement. Players are more likely to enjoy the game when they perceive the matches as fair and balanced. However, matchmaking remains a controversial topic in many popular titles. Players often suspect behind-the-scenes manipulations, such as forced win/loss cycles or engagement-based matchmaking mechanisms, which undermine trust in the ranking system.

This project proposes a data science-driven approach to investigate and improve matchmaking mechanisms in competitive games. By analyzing historical match data—including win/loss streaks, player skill ratings, team compositions, and in-game behaviors—we aim to identify patterns that affect match quality and player satisfaction.

The motivation for this research stems from observing the long-term efforts of Chinese content creator “LeiGeGame（磊哥游戏）,” who has been reverse-engineering the matchmaking mechanism in *Honor of Kings*.

### Machine Learning Models:
1. **Regression Models**:
   - **Linear Regression**: Useful for modeling the relationship between a player's performance metrics and perceived fairness scores.
   - **Logistic Regression**: Suitable if you're modeling binary outcomes, like whether a player considers a match fair or not.

2. **Clustering Algorithms**:
   - **K-means Clustering**: Can help group players based on their background data and behavior trends. This is useful to identify patterns related to fairness perceptions.
   - **DBSCAN**: Effective for identifying clusters with noise, which could help in detecting outlier behaviors like smurfing or win-trading.

3. **Classification Algorithms**:
   - **Random Forest or Decision Trees**: Offer interpretability, allowing for insight into which factors most significantly impact perceived fairness.
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**: Useful for higher-dimensional feature spaces, especially when creating complex decision boundaries related to fairness.

4. **Neural Networks**:
   - **Feedforward Networks**: Suitable for complex, non-linear relationships if you have a large dataset.
   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Ideal for capturing temporal dependencies in player behavior over sequences of matches.

### Statistical Models:
1. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - If your dataset includes temporal data, time series models like ARIMA can analyze trends and seasonal effects on perceived fairness.

2. **Bayesian Models**:
   - Offer the ability to incorporate prior knowledge into analysis and can be particularly useful for understanding player behavioral trends and uncertainty in matchmaking.

These models can be tailored to specific questions you're investigating, such as examining the effects of skill disparities or win/loss streaks on fairness perceptions. Each has its strengths and trade-offs, so selecting the right one depends on data size, complexity, and your desired level of interpretability.

",Student
6026,2025-04-03 12:38:41.976,"Simulating a matchmaking dataset can be a valuable exercise when real data is unavailable. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

### Steps to Simulate a Matchmaking Dataset:

1. **Define Player Attributes**:
   - Create variables such as skill level, experience time (e.g., hours played), and rank tier.
   - Consider behavioral traits such as aggression or defensiveness, which could simulate realistic in-game actions.

2. **Generate Match Outcomes**:
   - Simulate match results (win/loss) using a skill differential algorithm, where player/team skill levels determine probable outcomes.
   - Introduce randomness to outcomes to simulate real-life uncertainty and surprise victories or defeats.

3. **Construct Fairness Indicators**:
   - Define a perceived fairness variable based on factors like matching accuracy, sudden changes in player performance, and expected versus actual outcomes.

4. **Include Behavioral Trends**:
   - Simulate player decisions post-match, like quitting (using a probability related to perceived unfairness) or continued play (linked to perceived fairness).

5. **Incorporate Time Series**:
   - Add a temporal component by simulating matches over time to study trends like a player’s win/loss streaks and their impact on perceived fairness.

6. **Add Noise and Outliers**:
   - Introduce noise to data to simulate unpredictable player behaviors like smurfing, which will help in testing robustness of fairness analyses.

7. **Use Synthetic Data Tools**:
   - Tools like Faker in Python can help generate realistic player profiles.
   - Libraries like NumPy or Pandas can facilitate random data generation and manipulation, allowing extensive control over distributions and dependencies.

### Example:
Generate matches using a Gaussian distribution centered around an average skill level. For outcomes, factor in deviations caused by temporary boosts (e.g., player having a 'good day') or handicaps (e.g., internet lag).

This fictional dataset can be adjusted and expanded to align closely with the scenarios you wish to analyze, helping you model potential outcomes effectively. If you need help with coding these simulations, feel free to ask!",Chatbot

1. Introduction

In competitive multiplayer games, the matchmaking system plays a decisive role in player experience and long-term engagement. Players are more likely to enjoy a game when they feel the matches are fair and balanced. However, matchmaking remains a controversial topic in many popular games. Players often suspect behind-the-scenes manipulations, such as mandatory win/loss cycles or engagement-based matchmaking mechanisms, which can reduce the perceived fairness of the ranking system. These suspicions are not limited to one title—concerns about hidden matchmaking mechanisms have also emerged in games like League of Legends, CS:GO, and Dota 2.

This project proposes a data science-based approach to study and improve matching mechanisms in competitive games. By analyzing historical match data (including win/loss streak records, player skill scores, team compositions, and in-game behaviors), we aim to identify potential patterns that affect match quality and player satisfaction. The project’s measurable objectives include reducing post-match quit rates and improving fairness perception scores based on simulated evaluation scenarios.

The motivation for this research stems from a long-term observation of Chinese content creator “LeiGeGame（磊哥游戏）” analyzing the matchmaking mechanism of “Honor of Kings.” His community-based reverse engineering research inspired me to explore how to use data science to add transparency and fairness to this usually opaque system. This direction is consistent with broader industry trends toward explainability and ethical AI design.

6041,2025-03-30 06:22:36.925,"what is Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques 

",Student
6041,2025-03-30 06:22:44.646,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a valuable way. Here’s an overview of NLP techniques:

### Key NLP Techniques:

1. **Tokenization**: This involves breaking down text into individual words or tokens. It's a basic step that makes subsequent text analysis possible.

2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Annotates every token in a sentence with its part of speech (e.g., noun, verb), which helps in understanding the grammatical structure of the text.

3. **Stemming and Lemmatization**: These processes reduce words to their base or root form. Stemming uses a crude heuristic, while lemmatization considers the context and grammar to deliver more accurate root forms.

4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and categorizes key information (entities) in the text, such as names of people, organizations, or locations.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluates text to determine its sentiment, whether positive, negative, or neutral. This is commonly used in analyzing social media posts to gauge public opinion.

6. **Topic Modeling**: Analyzes large volumes of text data to identify abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents.

7. **Language Modeling**: Predicts the probability distribution of linguistic units like words or phrases. It is a backbone for more complex tasks like translation and speech recognition.

8. **Sequential Labeling and Parsing**: Involves dividing text into meaningful sections or parsing sentences for better syntactical and semantic understanding.

### Applications of NLP:
- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: Enable automatic understanding and response in conversation.
- **Machine Translation**: Translate text or speech from one language to another.
- **Information Retrieval and Extraction**: Locate and summarize relevant information from large datasets.
- **Spam Detection**: Classify messages to identify unsolicited or irrelevant messages.

NLP combines computational linguistics and machine learning to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data, making it integral to applications that require language understanding.",Chatbot
6041,2025-03-30 06:23:47.113, LSTM-based sentiment models,Student
6041,2025-03-30 06:23:57.825,"LSTM, or Long Short-Term Memory, is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is particularly effective for sequence prediction problems, such as sentiment analysis of text. Here’s a breakdown of how LSTM-based sentiment models work:

### Understanding LSTMs:
- **Sequential Data Processing**: LSTMs are designed to process and predict sequences. They are well-suited for tasks where context from previous inputs significantly affects the current output — a key requirement in sentiment analysis where word order matters.
- **Memory Cells**: LSTMs have a built-in memory feature that allows them to remember (or forget) previous inputs over long sequences, overcoming the limitations of basic RNNs like vanishing gradients.
- **Gates Mechanism**: They utilize gates to control the flow of information. These include input, forget, and output gates that determine which parts of the information should be updated, retained, or outputted.

### Application in Sentiment Analysis:
- **Text as Input Sequence**: In sentiment analysis, an LSTM model would typically process a sentence or document as a sequence of word vectors. Pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe can represent words numerically.
- **Sentiment Prediction**: During training, the LSTM learns to associate particular sequences of word vectors with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). It understands context and nuances in language better due to its structure, making it suitable for detecting sentiments influenced by word order and sentence structure.

### Why Use LSTMs for Sentiment?
- **Captures Context**: LSTMs effectively capture the context within a phrase or across sentences in a document, which is vital for accurate sentiment analysis.
- **Versatile**: They can handle longer sequences and dependencies, which are common in natural language.

LSTM-based models have become a popular choice for sentiment analysis due to their ability to model complex linguistic patterns and relationships in textual data.",Chatbot

6041,2025-03-31 11:05:48.218,"Related Work

Prior research has demonstrated that social media sentiment correlates with market behavior. Bollen et al. (2011) showed that collective mood states from Twitter can predict changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2018) applied LSTM-based sentiment models to forecast short-term stock measurements, while Mittal and Goel (2012) found that Twitter sentiment could outperform traditional market indicators.




However, most studies focus on sentiment-based price prediction and treat sentiment as a continuous variable over time. Few address the detection of discrete, emotionally charged events that deviate from expected market movements. Recent developments in event-based financial modeling (e.g., Ding et al., 2015) propose combining event extraction with price movement analysis, but rarely include social propagation paths or source attribution.




The proposal builds upon this foundation by shifting the analytical focus from pure sentiment prediction to event-level detection and classification. By incorporating both financial volatility data and emotion-triggered social signals, the system seeks to identify and classify significant market events, enabling early warnings and post-event tracing.

**Introduction**

Social media has increasingly influenced financial markets, as seen in events like the GameStop surge and Elon Musk's tweets impacting stock prices. Traditional models, which focus on quantitative data like price and volume, often miss emotional triggers driving these events. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect emotions from social media, identifying when these emotional surges align with unusual stock activity. By analyzing differences across platforms like Reddit and Twitter, we aim to anticipate which emotional narratives could move markets.

**Related Work**

Previous studies show social media sentiment correlates with market behavior. Bollen et al. (2011) linked Twitter moods to Dow Jones changes, while Zhang et al. (2018) and Mittal and Goel (2012) demonstrated that social media data often predicts stock trends more effectively than traditional signals. However, these studies mainly predict prices continuously over time, not specific moments of emotional spikes and trading anomalies. This project will address these gaps by using real-time social media data to detect and trace the spread of sentiment-driven market events.

**Business Model**

Our system provides valuable insights into the financial sector. Revenue comes from software tools that detect emotion-driven financial events. We offer:

- **Revenue Streams**: Subscription plans, cloud-based analytics, and custom reports.
- **Product Components**: Tools for hedge funds, retail apps, financial institutions, and analytics providers.
- **Cost Structure**: Mainly focused on developing the analytics platform and AI models.

**Value Proposition**

- Early detection of high-risk events through emotion tracking.
- Better understanding and strategy development in response to market anomalies.
- Visualization of sentiment patterns across platforms.

**Commercial Potential**

Available via subscription-based APIs, integration in fintech and algorithmic platforms, and as a SaaS solution for hedge funds and asset managers. Our tool provides an edge by interpreting emotional market drivers, helping in transparent and informed decision-making.

",Student
6121,2025-04-06 14:32:12.319,"Multimodal refers to the use of multiple forms of input or types of data in a single analytical process or system. In the context of data science and machine learning, this often means combining different types of data such as text, images, audio, or video in one model to improve the accuracy and robustness of the system.

For example, in the case of detecting misinformation, a multimodal approach could involve analyzing the text of a tweet (using Natural Language Processing) alongside any attached images or videos (using computer vision techniques). By processing both the textual and visual information, the system can make more informed decisions, such as identifying mismatches between the text and images or videos, which might indicate misinformation.

Multimodal approaches are particularly useful when single-modality systems (focusing on just text or just images) are insufficient to capture the full context, leading to improved performance in tasks like sentiment analysis, scene understanding, or, in your case, misinformation detection.

analyze text-based misinformation",Student
6121,2025-04-06 14:36:08.879,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning techniques to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

In the context of misinformation detection, NLP models are used to analyze the text for patterns or anomalies indicative of misinformation. Models like RoBERTa and BERT are powerful tools in NLP:

1. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):**
   - Developed by Google, BERT is designed to understand the context of a word in search queries. It uses a bidirectional approach, meaning it reads text both ways (left-to-right and right-to-left) to grasp context and meanings better.

2. **RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach):**
   - An optimized and improved variant of BERT, RoBERTa enhances BERT's performance by training over larger datasets and with more intensive model settings. It’s designed to outperform BERT in various language-based tasks by refining how it processes language data.

These models are well-suited for misinformation detection because they can understand the nuances and subtleties of language, making them capable of identifying misleading or deceptive content in text data.

It encompasses the resources available to individuals and groups through their social networks and interactions. These resources can include trust, reciprocity, information, and cooperation—factors that facilitate collective action and access to opportunities. Social capital is seen as a key element in building strong communities and contributing to personal success, as it often provides social support and access to valuable resources like job opportunities or information.

Aspirational Capital is a term derived from the concept of community cultural wealth, referring to the ability to maintain hopes and dreams for the future, even in the face of real and perceived barriers. It's about the capacity to envision possible futures beyond current circumstances, often passed down through storytelling and inspiration from others who have succeeded despite challenges. Aspirational capital encourages resilience and persistence, allowing individuals to set and pursue higher goals, such as educational achievements or career aspirations, despite obstacles.

Both social and aspirational capital are critical in education and career development, as they empower individuals with the necessary networks and mindset to pursue opportunities and overcome barriers.

Abstract

Traditionally, we have been attempting to extract useful features from the massive amount of data generated daily. However, following the legal constraints regarding personal data protection and the challenges of potential data biases and manipulation, artificial intelligence that relies less on big data and more on reasoning ability has become an emerging trend. This paper demonstrates how to estimate age and gender using names only. The proposed two-layer comparative model was trained on Taiwanese names, and its generalizability was further examined on bilingual and cross-border names. By considering additional features of the contextual environment, the model achieves high accuracy in age and gender prediction on Taiwanese and bilingual names. However, the prediction results for ethnic-Chinese Malaysian names (in English) do not reach the same level. This is due to the linguistic differences among Chinese dialects; the features trained on Taiwanese names cannot be directly applied to English names in Malaysia. This study illustrates a path for accomplishing prediction tasks using minimal data and highlights a future possibility for further research.""",Student

Parents strive to provide safe environments for their children. However, they often overlook online safety, giving devices without considering digital hazards. Studies link social media use to depression, but poor data prevents strong conclusions (Khalaf et al., 2023). Reports show 80% of young children used age-inappropriate social media (Fraser, 2025); concerns about platform safety remain (Tirrell, 2023).

Registration requires age, yet fake data accesses content. Children using parents' devices encounter risks. Without strong monitoring tools for under-15s, it's crucial to identify user age through patterns, boosting automatic censorship safeguards against predators.

With a booming global social media population (Larson, 2024), banning under-15s is tough. Data science is vital for accurate, automatic age-group classification. This project uses k-means clustering on social media activity to age-group users, enhancing safety with content filters.

1.
Introduction



According to the World Health Organization’s report (WHO,
2024), the number of diabetes patients has grown dramatically over the past
thirty years. The adult prevalence rate increased from 7% (1990) to 14% (2022).
Among these, low- and middle-income countries saw the highest increase, with
Malaysia being one of them. The report also points out that as the diabetes
rate has surged, the time patients need to spend for consultations, waiting,
and diagnosing has greatly increased. Moreover, doctors often have a vague
understanding of whether diabetes symptoms are mild or severe, and they can't
effectively provide personalized treatment plans for patients (Shalihin et al.,
2020). However, if diabetes is diagnosed early, patients can be fully treated
with medication or lifestyle changes and can recover completely. If not treated
in time, it could lead to blindness, kidney failure, and even death. 





The diagnosis of diabetes is usually done through blood tests,
where the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) level should be below 5.7% to be considered
normal, and between 5.7% to 6.4% is diagnosed as prediabetes. This blood test
process typically takes two to three months. If we could predict earlier whether
a patient has diabetes, and the severity of the condition, based on their
weight, age, blood pressure, blood lipid levels, and other characteristics, it
could help with early diagnosis (Jensen et al.,2021). These results would be double
checked by doctors for further accuracy. The diabetes detection and treatment
system aims to create an automated classifier based on a machine learning KNN
(K-Nearest Neighbors) classbification method, helping doctors assess and
diagnose whether a patient has diabetes and the severity of the symptoms. The
classifier will use the patient's blood results and other physiological
indicators collected at the clinic to categorize them into groups such as require
further evaluation by doctors, normal group and certainly be diagnosed (Bukhari
et al., 2021). This will reduce the number of reports that doctors need to
review and can provide customized treatment plans based on the different
conditions of patients.





This project will help diabetes patients receive early
intervention, reduce waiting times for appointments, and potentially achieve
recovery. It will also help reduce doctors' workload, lower the risks and costs
borne by healthcare insurance companies (e.g., only paying for initial testing,
preventing the need for high-cost surgeries later on), thus achieving multiple
benefits with one approach. 



2. Related Work



Diabetes is a
global health challenge, which has led to the development of early diagnosis
technologies based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Research
(like Sahin et al., 2020) shows that models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest can predict the risk of
diabetes using data like age, BMI, and blood pressure. Systems like IBM Watson
Health and Google Health combine medical imaging, lab data, and patient history
to improve diagnostic accuracy. Mobile apps like MySugr help patients manage
their blood sugar with tracking and algorithm-based feedback, while screening
programs from organizations like the American Diabetes Association (ADA) focus
on standardized tests like the A1C test. However, these approaches neglect the
fact that diabetes is a multifactorial disease caused by the interplay of
multiple contributing factors. Exclusively focusing on isolated factors such as
blood glucose or body fat is highly limiting. Consequently, while
advancements in blood glucose research are notable, existing methods still fail
to empower patients to better understand the root causes of their symptoms or
implement more effective early interventions.




2.1
Limitations of Current Methods:




Reliance on Single Indicators for Diagnosis: Most current models depend on a
single data point (like blood sugar levels) for diagnosis. They lack a
comprehensive analysis of genetic factors, lifestyle, physical indicators, and
environmental factors, which can lead to misdiagnosis.





Lack of Personalized Treatment Plans: Most existing models focus only on
diagnosis and don’t create personalized treatment plans based on a patient’s
current symptoms.





Complications Affecting Diagnosis: In resource-poor areas, complications
like kidney disease often cause late diagnosis, which makes treatment and
diagnosis more difficult.




2.2
Innovations of This Project:




Multi-Indicator Fusion Prediction Model: This model integrates a patient's
physical indicators, demographics, and environmental data to predict risk,
rather than relying only on blood sugar levels. This improves accuracy and
prevents misdiagnosis.





Automated Evaluation and Categorization: The model evaluates and categorizes
patients based on their health data, placing them into risk categories (high,
medium, low). This helps patients better understand their current health
status, take different treatment actions, and reduces the doctor’s workload by
focusing on high-risk patients and providing more effective treatment.





Personalized Treatment Plans: Based on risk levels and health
indicators, personalized plans are generated, breaking through the limitations
of standardized treatment plans used by doctors.



3. Business
Model



This project
is mainly aimed at applications in the healthcare field. For example, it could
provide every clinic with a medical testing system, where all the related
patient data should be entered, and it will automatically generate corresponding
test reports which provide a business opportunity for the health insurance
companies. The tool can be sold to local small clinics and hospitals in remote
areas to provide better diabetes screening services. This would reduce the cost
of testing, improve diagnostic accuracy, and cut down the time spent on diagnosing
issues, which can prevent patients from delaying in
treatment and increase the risk of critical conditions. It also provides
personalized treatment suggestions based on different symptoms, allowing for
better treatment. 




Stakeholder

several stakeholder groups, summarized as follows: 




3.1
Health Insurance Companies:




a. It will help diagnose diabetes earlier, reducing treatment
claims for diabetes patients and avoiding the higher costs of surgical
treatments. 





b. It helps doctors reduce the chances
of misdiagnosis, which means fewer

a. The system will enable faster and more accurate diagnoses of
diabetes. 





b. It will help recommend more appropriate treatment plans. 





c. It reduces the time spent on
diagnosis, allowing more
consultation time and enabling
doctors to treat more seriously patients. 




3.3

a. It reduces waiting times for appointments, making the medical experience
better and more efficient. 





b. It provides earlier and simpler treatment, with fewer side effects, prevent increasing mortality rates. 





c. It offers patients personalized, more effective treatment plans, helping them recover
faster.
